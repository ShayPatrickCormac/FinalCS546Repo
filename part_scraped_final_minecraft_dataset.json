This turns it into a wet sponge, which can be smelted or placed in the Nether to dry it to be reused. Sponges can only be found in ocean monuments.\n\nObtaining\n    Dry sponge does not generate in the world.\n\n  Breaking\n    Either type of sponge can be mined by hand, or with any tool, dropping itself as an item; however, hoes break sponges the fastest compared to other tools.\n\n    Block,Sponge Wet Sponge\n\n    Hardness,0.6\n\n    Tool,Hoe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.9\n\n    Wooden,0.45\n\n    Stone,0.25\n\n    Iron,0.15\n\n    Diamond,0.15\n\n    Netherite,0.1\n\n    Golden,0.1\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Ocean monuments can generate \"sponge rooms.\" Each room contains an average of 30 wet sponges. See Ocean Monument/Structure for details.\n\n  Mob loot\n    An elder guardian always drops one wet sponge when killed by the player.\n\n  Smelting\n    A wet sponge can be dried in a furnace, making the sponge reusable.\n\n    Ingredients,Smelting recipe,Description\n\n    Wet sponge + any fuel,0.15,\"If a bucket is in the fuel slot at the time the sponge completes its drying, the water drains into the bucket, leaving a bucket of water in the fuel slot. Otherwise, the water just evaporates.\"\n\n\n  Drying\n    A wet sponge placed in the Nether dries out instantly with a puff of steam and turns into a normal sponge. A wet sponge placed in any dry biome in the Overworld dries out after a few minutes and turns into a normal sponge.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] If a normal sponge comes into contact with water in a dry biome, it absorbs the water and immediately dries out with a puff of steam.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]\n\nUsage\n    A sponge can be used to turn water into air by \"absorbing\" the water. A sponge instantly absorbs nearby water when it is placed next to water or when water comes into contact with it. Sponges immediately turn wet upon absorption and do not absorb any more water afterwards. Wet sponges drip small water particles. Sponges in item form do not absorb water or become wet. A sponge absorbs both flowing and source blocks of water up to 7 blocks away (taken as a taxicab distance) in all six directions around itself. Instead of a cube or a sphere, this effectively encloses the volume of an octahedron with vertices placed 7 units away from the center in each direction due to the game's extensive use of taxicab distance. A sponge does not absorb more than 65 blocks of water however, and water closest to the sponge is absorbed first. The absorption propagates only between adjacent water blocks and does not \"jump over\" non-water blocks, including air.\n\n",

Specially, oak leaves\u200c[Java Edition  only] or jungle leaves\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] generate in jungle bushes. Oak leaves also generate in the tree at meeting points in plains villages. Dark oak leaves also generate in woodland mansions.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Leaves generate as part of trees grown from saplings or azalea.\n\nUsage\n    Leaves from trees spontaneously decay (disappear) when they receive a block tick if they are not connected to a block with the logs tag (log or wood block), either directly or via other leaf blocks, with a maximum distance of 6 blocks\u200c[Java Edition  only] or 4 blocks\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]. Leaves placed by players never decay. Leaves that decay, or are destroyed without using Silk Touch or shears, yield saplings 5% (1\u204420) of the time, sticks 2% of the time, and otherwise drop nothing. Jungle leaves drop saplings 2.5% (1\u204440) of the time. Oak and dark oak leaves also have a separate but additional 0.5% (1\u2044200) chance of dropping an apple, making it extremely rare but possible for a single leaf to drop a sapling, a stick and an apple at the same time. Rates are increased by the Fortune enchantment. Leaves that are burned do not yield saplings or apples. Leaves take on a different shade of green depending on the biome in which they are placed. Leaves are always transparent to light, but cannot be seen through when the graphics mode is set to \"Fast\"; the transparent regions are instead black\u200c[JE  only]/dark green\u200c[BE  only]. They diffuse sky light, causing the shadows they cast under trees. Leaves can be waterlogged, despite being a full block. Water does not spread out\u200c[Java Edition  only] and waterlogged leaves follow the same rules as any other waterlogged block. When concrete powder is placed on any side of the waterlogged leaves it turns into concrete, without the danger of the water running out of the block. Applying bone meal to mangrove leaves with a space beneath produces a hanging mangrove propagule with age=0.\n\n  Redstone component\n    The state of a leaves block\u2014including a player-placed block\u2014changes after 1 game tick (half a redstone tick) when the distance to the nearest log or wood block changes, up to 6 blocks of leaves away. Observers facing away from the leaves detect this change and transmit a redstone signal in the same game tick, making leaves useful for redstone signal transmission. This has been called \"Leafstone\" by the Minecraft Community.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Leaves are destroyed when pushed by pistons. They do not stick to sticky pistons, slime blocks or honey blocks.\n\n  Composting\n    Leaves have a 30% chance of increasing the compost level in a composter by 1. A stack of leaves yields an average of 2.74 bonemeal.\n\n  Bees\n    Flowering azaleas leaves and cherry leaves function like any other flowers in their interaction and uses with bees.\n\n  Bee nests\n    Oak and birch trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flowering azalea leaves have a 5% chance to grow with bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.\n\n  Color\n    These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

This is what makes netherrack renewable. Crimson or warped nylium transforms into netherrack if a solid, opaque block is directly above it, or when it is covered by snow.[1]\n\nUsage\n    Netherrack is mostly used as a cheap building block. Because of its abundance and softness, it is often used to construct temporary structures that can be used for scaffolding, blockage, or other purposes. When netherrack's top is lit on fire, the fire burns indefinitely. Unlike soul fire, this fire can spread. Using bone meal on netherrack placed next to warped nylium or crimson nylium transforms the netherrack into more warped or crimson nylium.

Explosions by TNT or creepers also cause snow to yield a snowball. Snow drops one item of itself per layer when mined using a shovel enchanted with Silk Touch, except for 8 layers of snow, which drops a snow block.[1] Any other tool, even if enchanted with Silk Touch, destroys the snow and drops nothing. In Bedrock Edition, destroying top snow with a shovel yields 1-4 snowballs. The number of snowballs dropped is as follows: 1 snowball for 1-3 layers, 2 snowballs for snow 4-5 layers, 3 snowballs for 6-7 layers, and 4 snowballs for 8 layers. Unlike Java Edition, shovels enchanted with Silk Touch cause top snow to drop snowballs.[2] Top snow can also be removed by using a shovel on it if there is no block directly above the snow layer, yielding 1-4 snowballs. One snowball is dropped&emdash;regardless of the number of layers&emdash;if top snow falls into an invalid block space after its support block is destroyed.\n\n    Block,Snow\n\n    Hardness,0.1\n\n    Tool,wooden shovel\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.5\n\n    Wooden,0.1\n\n    Stone,0.05\n\n    Iron,0.05\n\n    Diamond,0.05\n\n    Netherite,0.05\n\n    Golden,0.05\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Snow naturally generates in snowy biomes, cold biomes, and other biomes depending on the elevation and temperature. Only blocks with direct access to the sky can generate snow layers naturally (with the exception of some buildings in snowy villages, which generate extra snow in areas inaccessible to the sky).[3] Top snow generates where there is sky access atop buildings in snowy taiga villages.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Snow generates as piles and in multiple layers as part of many snowy plains village structures. By default, snow generates exclusively in single layers in Java Edition. Top snow can generate in multiple layers in Bedrock Edition. Snow also generates in ancient cities.\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Snow Block,\"[[None, None, None], ['Snow Block', 'Snow Block', 'Snow Block'], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Post-generation\n    In snowy biomes or in cold biomes at higher altitudes, the weather can produce snow instead of rain. In snowy weather, snow generates on random blocks with a complete solid top surface at integer y-values, with a block light level of 9 or less, with the exception of ice and packed ice. The rate at which snow forms is affected by the game rule randomTickSpeed. Below are the altitudes at which rain ends and snow begins, depending on the biome. The exact height of the snow line is randomized. In taiga, for example, the lowest possible snow layer forms at y level 153, and the lowest height where snow forms at all locations is y=168, with snow lines ranging between y levels 153 and 168 across different locations.\n\n    Biome,Layer\n\n    All snowy biomes,y -64 (All altitudes)\n\n    Windswept Gravelly Hills Windswept Hills Windswept Forest Stony Shore [4] Dripstone Caves \u200c [ BE only ] [5],y 113\u2013128\n\n    Taiga Old Growth Spruce Taiga,y 153\u2013168\n\n    Old Growth Pine Taiga Meadow \u200c [ BE only ] [ needs\u00a0testing ] Cherry Grove \u200c [ BE only ] [ needs\u00a0testing ],y 193\u2013208\n\n    All others except Dry/Hot Biomes,Above y 320 (not possible)\n\n    Frozen Ocean Deep Frozen Ocean,Depends on location\n\n\n    In Bedrock Edition, up to two layers of top snow can build up during snowfall. In Java Edition, snowfall creates one layer of snow by default, and the number of layers that can accumulate can be altered by the game rule snowAccumulationHeight: the default value being 1, while setting it to 0 makes no snow form at all, and setting it to 8 or above lets snow form up to the level of a full block. Snow layers do not generate if the game rule doWeatherCycle has been set to false.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Snow golems generate a trail of snow in snowy, cold, and some medium biomes, or any non-dry biome in Bedrock Edition.\n\nUsage\n    Snow can be placed only on a solid block that is not ice. In Java Edition, snow breaks if its support block is removed. In Bedrock Edition, snow is affected by gravity and falls if it becomes unsupported, and breaks if it falls onto an unsuitable block. A player can jump up 1 block and 3 snow layers.\n\n  Cover\n    If the snow is on a grass block (or mycelium or podzol in Java Edition[6]) the ground cover turns white on the top and around the sides. Snow does not damage tilled and hydrated field areas \u2013 it cannot be placed on farmland. A gravity-affected block like sand or gravel does not fall if snow covers the block below it, but the gravity-affected block does replace a snow layer when falling onto it. The texture of the grass block changes to snowy when a single layer of snow is placed on top.[7][8] Thicker layers of snow causes the grass block to revert to plain dirt when the block receives a random tick, similar to regular grass when covered by an opaque block. A plain dirt block with a single layer of snow on top gains a snowy texture if grass spreads to it. In Bedrock Edition, if leaves are topped with a layer of snow, particles of snow appear to fall through the leaves from the snow layer. In Bedrock Edition, snow layers can occupy the same space as one-block flowers, mushrooms, and one-block ferns and grass, (however two-block tall plants do not work)[9] and can be layered and mined normally. Placing snow on already-existing plant blocks causes snow to appear around them, but placing plants into an area where there is snow removes the snow.[10] Snow layers can be used to kill nylium.[11]\n\n  Melting\n    Snow melts if there is a heat block,\u200c[BE & edu  only] or block light level of 12 or more. In Bedrock Edition, it also melts in dry biomes, regardless of block light or daylight level. If there are multiple layers, layers melt gradually in Bedrock Edition, but they melt all at once in Java. Some light sources can melt snow but many cannot.

When left alone, wheat seeds planted on farmland grow to become wheat crops, which can be harvested by the player. Planted seeds require a light level of 9 or greater to continue growing. If the light level is 7 or below, the crops instantly un-plant themselves (\"pop off\"). It is not possible to plant seeds if the light level is too low. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5. Breaking the final stage produces 1 to 4 wheat seeds (or more with Fortune) and 1 wheat. If they are harvested early, they drop 1 seed without any wheat. Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\n\n  Breeding\n    Like other seeds, wheat seeds can be used to breed chickens and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby chickens by 10%. Chickens also follow a player holding wheat seeds.\n\n  Taming\n    Like other seeds, wheat seeds can be used to tame parrots.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing wheat seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of wheat seeds yields an average of 2.74 bonemeal.\n\n",

Mobs cannot spawn on lily pads. A lily pad is broken and drops as an item when water flows on it. Normal blocks can be placed on the bottom side of lily pads (from below). This breaks the lily pad (dropping it as an item), but leaves the block in place.  Blocks can also be placed on top of lily pads, though the placed block appears to hover over the pad rather than rest on it.[1] A lily pad can be used as a starting point for construction on an ocean surface without having to build up from the ocean floor (see also kelp for this purpose).\n\n  Placement\n    Lily pads can be placed only on top of water, ice or frosted ice. Lily pads occupy the block above water and are not part of the water block itself. Lily pads must be directly planted on the top of a water, ice or frosted ice block; unlike most blocks, targeting the side of a block that would result in it being placed on top of a valid block does not allow it to be placed. Similarly, targeting the sides or bottom of a block that can support a lily pad will place the lily pad on top.[2] In Java Edition, lily pads can be placed on waterlogged blocks, including top half slabs. A lily pad faces a consistent direction that depends on its location; it is unaffected by the direction the player faces. Replacing a lily pad does not change the direction. In Bedrock Edition, unlike most blocks entities can collide with, lily pads can be placed directly inside players.[3][4]\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a lily pad into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\nAppearance\n",

It is sometimes visible through the windows from outside.\nStronghold\nOne silverfish monster spawner in the end portal room.\nNether fortress\nOne or two blaze monster spawners on fenced platforms with full-block \"stairs\" leading up to them. Normally two are generated per fortress, but there can be fewer.\nBastion remnant\nOne magma cube monster spawner hanging from a chain underneath a bridge in treasure rooms.\n\nUsage\n    The monster spawner spawns mobs in an (at most) 9\u00d73\u00d79 volume (see \u00a7 Mechanics) around it when the player is within 16 blocks. Suitable spawning locations for the block's mob type are provided in or around the spawning volume. The monster spawner attempts to spawn four mobs around it, then waits from 10 to 39.95 seconds before attempting to spawn more. In Peaceful difficulty, monster spawners still activate but do not spawn monsters in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, zombified piglins, magma cubes, and ghasts do not spawn at all and other hostile mobs disappear immediately after spawning. Monster spawners are transparent, but they behave like leaves in that they diffuse sky light coming from directly above. In Bedrock Edition, they have a hitbox slightly smaller than a full block, and therefore, one can walk on the edge of a supporting full block directly below the monster spawner.\n\n  Mechanics\n    A monster spawner activates when a player (that's not in Spectator mode) comes within a spherical radius of 16 blocks from the center point of the block; i.e. 15.5 blocks from the monster spawner itself. The player's presence is determined by coordinates at their foot level, meaning that a player standing exactly 15.5 blocks below the spawner won't activate it, even though their head is in range. In Java Edition an active monster spawner attempts to spawn mobs within a 4-block horizontal and 1-block vertical range; that is, in a 9\u00d73\u00d79 volume centered on the monster spawner. In Bedrock Edition, the horizontal spawning range is 4 blocks taxicab distance, creating spawning volume extending 4 blocks in each cardinal horizontal direction from the sides of the monster spawner; its horizontal cross-section is therefore diamond-shaped. Mobs can spawn anywhere in this range that is suitable, with mobs more likely to spawn closer to the monster spawner than farther away. While mobs are spawned at fractional x and z-coordinates (i.e. not aligned to blocks), they are spawned at an integer y-coordinate. Horizontally, a mob can spawn with its center point anywhere within range, but vertically, mobs spawn with their legs at either the same layer as the monster spawner block, one block above it, or one block below it.  (Note that when there are other blocks slightly intersecting the mob's hitbox, they can sometimes glitch further away - often up - but this does not make it a true spawning point.) The monster spawner attempts to spawn 4 mobs at randomly chosen points within the spawning volume, then waits anywhere from 200 to 799 ticks (10 to 39.95 seconds) before spawning again. As it waits, the mob model inside the block spins faster and faster. Except for the normal solid-block spawning requirement, all the remaining ones must be met (not in a solid block, correct light level, etc.), so the monster spawner often produces fewer than 4 mobs. When it does spawn, it emits a \"poof\", and more flame particles temporarily appear around it. If the monster spawner fails to spawn any mobs because it did not pick any suitable locations, it repeats this process every tick until it succeeds. It only starts the next wait cycle after successfully spawning at least one mob. If 6 or more mobs of the monster spawner's type have their hitbox intersecting a 9\u00d79\u00d79 volume centered on the monster spawner block in Java Edition or a 16\u00d710\u00d716 volume centered on the lower northwest corner of the monster spawner block in Bedrock Edition, the monster spawner \"poofs\" without creating any mobs and then waits for the next cycle. [needs\u00a0testing\u00a0in Bedrock Edition] This is checked before each of the four spawn attempts. The monster spawner performs a relaxed version of the ordinary spawning check: the general solid block requirement is removed, but the volume (hitbox of the mob) is kept along with some other checks according to mob specifics. As a result, for some types of mobs to spawn in the outer planes of the spawning volume, some planes outside the volume may also need to be free of solid blocks to conform with the mobs' height, width, or other rules governing their individual spawn volumes.

While the spawning volume for pigs is 8.9\u00d72.9\u00d78.9, the requirement of grass blocks that are necessary for pigs to spawn reduces the actual volume in which they successfully spawn to 8.9\u00d71.0\u00d78.9. Other mobs can spawn in mid-air, ignoring general rules about spawning on solid ground. The spawn conditions do not include biomes for most mobs. As such, monster spawners can place mobs where they normally wouldn't generate. For example, a mooshroom monster spawner can operate in a plains biome as long as there are mycelium blocks within the spawn area because the mooshroom's spawning code checks only for mycelium. The reason mooshrooms are not actually spawned elsewhere is that the game does not normally try to spawn them in other biomes: only the mushroom field biome has mooshroom on the list of things to spawn.\n\n  Disabling\n    The way a monster spawner can be disabled depends on the entity it tries to spawn. For a monster spawner that generates mobs that spawn only in dark conditions (light level = 0), a torch placed on any side or top of the monster spawner is sufficient to disable it for the whole 9\u00d73\u00d79 volume. For a blaze or silverfish monster spawner, a light level of 12 is required to prevent spawning. This can be achieved by: A monster spawner is also disabled by filling the spawning volume with solid blocks. This is often used to disable magma cube monster spawners, as magma cubes can spawn in any light level. However, since all magma cubes require the space of a large magma cube in order to spawn, a clever placement of as little as 9 solid blocks a layer above the monster spawner (see right image) can completely disable it.\n\n  Custom monster spawners\n    In Java Edition, using commands, monster spawners can be customized: Detailed technical information about custom monster spawners can be found below. In Bedrock Edition, monster spawner customization can not be done in the base game (i.e. without addons/behavior packs).\n\n  Note blocks\n    Monster spawner can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Monster spawners cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by sticky pistons.\n\n",

Placement To place a tripwire hook, use the Place Block control. In order to function correctly, a tripwire hook must be part of a \"tripwire circuit\": a straight line of blocks consisting of a block with a tripwire hook attached to it, a \"tripwire line\" (1 to 40 blocks of tripwire), and a second tripwire hook attached to another block, with both tripwire hooks facing the tripwire. To place tripwire, use the Place Block control with a string. Tripwire in a valid tripwire circuit has a short hitbox (0.09375 or 3/32 blocks high, with the bottom 0.0625 or 1/16 blocks above the block below), while tripwire not in a valid tripwire circuit has a taller hitbox (0.5 blocks high, bottom not raised). A tripwire hook in an invalid tripwire circuit appears \"folded\", while a tripwire hook in a valid tripwire circuit appears extended straight. Tripwire lines from separate tripwire circuits can be placed next to each other (in parallel), above each other, and even intersecting each other. Activation A tripwire hook in a valid tripwire circuit activates when certain entities (players, mobs, items, etc.) intersect the tripwire hook's tripwire line \"hitbox\" (but not the tripwire hook itself), and deactivates when all entities leave or are removed from the tripwire line. Entities that cannot activate a tripwire circuit include thrown potions, some arrows, fireworks, thrown ender pearls, and thrown eyes of ender. A tripwire hook also activates for 5 redstone ticks (0.5 seconds, barring lag) when any of its tripwires are destroyed, except when shears are used to destroy the tripwire. Breaking the tripwire hook, or breaking the block it is attached to, does not generate a pulse. Behavior While active, a tripwire hook appears to move downward and it:\npowers any adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, including beneath the tripwire hook\npowers any adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from the tripwire hook to power level 15\nstrongly powers its attachment block to power level 15\nactivates any adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc. Tripwire produces no power itself, but its state change can be detected with an observer. Although destroying tripwire with shears cannot activate a tripwire hook, it changes the tripwire hook's block state (its \"attached\" state from true to false), which can be detected with an observer.\n\n  Trading\n    Master-level fletcher villagers have a 2\u20443 chance to buy 8 tripwire hooks for an emerald as part of their trades in Java Edition, and always offer the trade in Bedrock Edition.\n\n",

To place a trapped chest, place the face of a block adjacent to the space the trapped chest should occupy. Placing two adjacent trapped chests side-by-side typically joins them to create a large trapped chest. To avoid them joining and instead place two single trapped chests side by side, the player may sneak while placing the second trapped chest,\u200c[Java Edition  only] or place the second trapped chest facing a different direction from the first one.\u200c[Bedrock and Java editions  only] Alternately, normal chests do not combine with trapped chests. Trapped chests can be moved by pistons.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Water and lava flow around without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to trapped chests as if they were flammable, but the chests do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either). Trapped chests can also activate buried TNT, destroying themselves, their contents and any mobs or players near them. They need to be opened twice for the TNT to be activated.\n\n  Container\n    A single trapped chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large trapped chest has 54 slots of inventory space. In a large trapped chest, the top three rows in the interface correspond to the western or northern chest block and the bottom three to the southern or eastern chest block. To open the trapped chest GUI, use the Use Item control. To move items between the trapped chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the trapped chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the trapped chest GUI, use the Esc control. By default, the GUI of a trapped chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large trapped chest is labeled \"Large Chest.\" A trapped chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the trapped chest in an anvil before placing it, or by using the data command\u200c[Java Edition  only] (for example, to label a trapped chest at (0,64,0) \"Loot!\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Loot!\"'}). If half of a large trapped chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large trapped chest, but if the named half is destroyed, the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large trapped chest have different names, the GUI label takes the name of the northernmost or westernmost half of the large trapped chest depending on its orientation (the half with the lowest coordinate in the appropriate axis). A trapped chest can be \"locked\" by setting the trapped chest's Lock tag. If a trapped chest's Lock tag is not blank, the trapped chest cannot be opened except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. A trapped chest's Lock tag can be set or unset with the data command. For example, to lock a trapped chest at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"Alice's Key\" can open the trapped chest, use data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Alice's Key\"}.\n\n  Redstone component\n    Trapped chests can be used to detect when their inventory is accessed by players. A trapped chest is inactive while not being accessed, but activates when accessed by a player (see above). Accessing either part of a large trapped chest activates both halves of the large trapped chest. Mobs cannot access/activate a trapped chest, and a trapped chest is not activated by items moving into or out of it by droppers or hoppers. While active, a trapped chest: An active trapped chest does not power any adjacent redstone comparators facing away from it. Redstone comparators can measure the block state of the trapped chest, producing a power level from 0 to 15 proportional to how full the trapped chest is. Anything else powered by an active trapped chest (including a block beneath it) can power redstone comparators normally.\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins become hostile toward players who open, break or interact with trapped chests.\n\n  Fuel\n    Trapped chests can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Trapped chests can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sound.\n\nChristmas chest\n    As with normal chests, on December 24, 25, and 26, trapped chests and large trapped chests have their textures changed to Christmas chests that look like presents.\n\n",

It is also found naturally in nether wart rooms of nether fortresses. Soul sand also generates in hoglin stables and housing unit bastion remnants. Soul sand also generates in soul sand valleys as part of the surface terrain. Soul sand can generate in the Nether in the form of ore blobs. Soul sand attempts to generate 12 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-23, from altitudes 0 to 31\u200c[JE  only] or 32\u200c[BE  only] , in soul sand valleys. It can replace only netherrack.

A cover with solid blocks of any non-zero physical thickness prevents sinking, and any solid cover thicker than half a block eliminates the slowing effect, too. The effect applies to sneaking, walking, sprinting, and crawling (but not gliding[needs\u00a0testing]), and to both regular and sprint-swimming. It also applies to riding mounts. Traveling by boat is slowed down, too, although this requires water no more than 2/8 a block in depth for the boat to sit low enough to be affected. Furthermore, it does not matter whether the player or mob moves actively or is being moved, like by flowing water. Most blocks that can be placed on full blocks can be placed on soul sand, with the notable exceptions of both types of fungi, both types of nether roots, and nether sprouts.[1] In addition, a falling block that lands on soul sand turns into an item,[2] which prevents gravel from replacing lava if soul sand is underneath. A hopper underneath a soul sand block can collect items that are dropped on it. Soul sand cannot be used in place of regular sand as a falling block because it is not affected by gravity. Striders are slowed down by soul sand underneath a layer of lava.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Soul Campfire,Stick + Soul Sand + Any Log or Stem or Any Stripped Log or Stem or Any Wood or Hyphae or Any Stripped Wood or Hyphae,\"[[None, 'Stick', None], ['Stick', '', 'Stick'], ['Oak Log', 'Oak Log', 'Oak Log']]\"\n\n    Soul Torch,Charcoal + Stick + Soul Sand,\"[[None, 'Charcoal', None], [None, 'Stick', None], [None, '', None]]\"\n\n\n  Growing nether wart\n    Soul sand is used for growing nether wart, a primary base ingredient for many varieties of potions. Nether warts can be placed on soul sand like seeds on farmland and over time they grow through four growth stages (placing the nether wart on soul sand grants the \"A Seedy Place\" advancement\u200c[Java Edition  only]). Nether warts can grow in any dimension and do not have any light-level requirements. Nether warts can also be placed only in soul sand (and cannot even be placed in soul soil).\n\n  Withers\n    Four blocks of soul sand (or soul soil) are used in the construction of the wither. The four blocks are arranged in a \"T\"-like formation (similar to the summoning of an iron golem) and 3 wither skeleton skulls are placed in a row on top of the \"T\" to summon the wither.\n\n  Bubble columns\n    Placing soul sand under source water blocks creates a lifting bubble column, which causes items, entities, players, and mobs inside the column to rise to the surface. The bubble column extends upward through any number of empty water source blocks (not waterlogged blocks). A player can restore breath by entering a soul sand's bubble column.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Soul sand can be placed under note blocks to produce cowbell sounds.\n\n  Fire\n    Fire lit on soul sand becomes soul fire, which burns indefinitely. Because soul sand is not as high as a full block, a player is set on fire if standing next to lava while on soul sand.[3] Standing near water while on soul sand extinguishes the player.\n\n",

Over time, a stem grows through several stages[needs\u00a0testing] and, at its final growth stage, will produce pumpkins on any adjacent dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots. If a pumpkin is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more pumpkins until the pumpkin is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of pumpkins. Pumpkin stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give pumpkins. Pumpkin seeds are affected by bone meal only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual pumpkins.\n\n  Breeding\n    Like other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\n\n  Taming\n    Like other seeds, pumpkin seeds can be used to tame parrots.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing pumpkin seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\nPumpkin stem\n    A pumpkin stem is the block that is planted on farmland when pumpkin seeds are used on it. It starts underground, and rises up as the plant grows. The stem is colored green when young, and then yellow once fully grown. The stem curves once a pumpkin has grown from it. A fully-grown single stem connects to any pumpkin in an adjacent square, thus there are 5 possible appearances to a stem. If there are multiple pumpkins it can connect to, it favors the east, then west, north, and south. When the pumpkin is removed, the stem returns to its straight shape.\n\n",

The pattern of the podzol reaches at most 6 blocks in the eastern and southern (positive X and Z) directions, and 5 blocks in the western and northern directions. In Java Edition, since podzol can be converted from moss blocks, and moss can be grown on renewable stone, dirt can be renewably created as long as there is access to water, lava, moss, spruce saplings and bone meal. This is especially useful on maps where dirt is limited.\n\nUsage\n    Like mycelium, podzol allows mushrooms to be placed on it no matter the light level, which allows the growth of huge mushrooms. Saplings, all kinds of flowers, and sugar cane can be placed on it normally. A podzol block can be turned into a dirt path by pressing use on it with any type of shovel, but it cannot be tilled with a hoe to make farmland.[2] However, the player can first use the shovel on the podzol to turn it into dirt path, then use the hoe on the dirt path to turn it into farmland.\n\n",

A sticky piston is a variant of the piston that can additonally pull most blocks when it retracts. Some blocks cannot be moved, break when pushed or have other interactions with pistons. A piston can move up to twelve blocks at once.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    A piston can be broken using any tool with equal efficiency, and always drops itself.\nIn Java Edition, it is faster to break them with a pickaxe.

When powered, the piston's wooden surface (the \"head\") starts extending immediately in Java Edition; or either 2 game ticks (1 redstone tick; 0.1 seconds) later or immediately, depending on how it was powered, in Bedrock Edition. When it extends, it pushes at most 12 blocks. The piston makes a sound that can be heard within a 31\u00d731\u00d731 cube centered on the activating piston. Any entities in the path of the extending head are pushed with the blocks. If there is no place for the entities to go, the block pushes inside them, suffocating mobs if the block is not transparent when pushed into the eye height of the mob. When a piston loses power, its head retracts. Like extending, this retraction starts immediately in Java Edition; or, depending on how it was powered, after 1 tick in Bedrock Edition. It finishes retracting 2 game ticks (1 redstone tick; 0.1 seconds) after it starts. A sticky piston also pulls the block attached to its head, but not any of the other blocks it may have pushed. Sticky pistons stick to a block only when retracting, so a block next to the piston head can be pushed aside by another piston and sticky pistons cannot hold falling blocks horizontally against gravity. In Java Edition, pistons finish extending early and start retracting if given a pulse shorter than 3 game ticks (1.5 redstone ticks; 0.15 seconds). These shorter pulses cause sticky pistons to \"drop\" their block, leaving it behind when trying to push it with a short pulse. Also, this causes the block to end up in its final position earlier. However, if they receive a short pulse and don't have a block to be pushed, they pull the block which is 1 block away. A piston that pushes a slime block bounces any entity that it displaces in the direction the piston is facing. In addition, when a slime block is moved by a piston, any movable blocks adjacent (not diagonally) to the slime block also moves. See the \"Slime blocks\" section below for more details. In Bedrock Edition, blocks that stick to walls (such as levers) can be placed on pistons or sticky pistons without being destroyed when activated.\n\n  Limitations\n    Pistons can push most blocks, and sticky pistons can pull most blocks, except those listed in the table below. A sticky piston simply leaves a block behind if it cannot pull it. Pistons cannot push blocks into the void or beyond the top of the map. They also cannot push more than 12 blocks. If the requirements for a block to be pushed are not met, the piston simply does not extend.\n\n    Block,Effect ( Java Edition ),Effect ( Bedrock Edition )\n\n    Barrier Beacon Bedrock Command Block Crying Obsidian Enchanting Table End Gateway End Portal End Portal Frame Ender Chest Grindstone Jigsaw Block Jukebox Light Lodestone Monster Spawner Moving Piston Nether Portal Obsidian Piston (extended) Piston Head Reinforced Deepslate Respawn Anchor Sculk Catalyst Sculk Sensor Sculk Shrieker Structure Block Structure Void \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ],Cannot be pushed or pulled.\n\n    Allow Deny Border,N/A,Cannot be pushed or pulled.\n\n    Compound Creator Element Element Constructor Hardened Glass Hardened Glass Pane Heat Block Lab Table Material Reducer Underwater TNT,Can be pushed or pulled.\n\n    Underwater Torch Colored Torches,\"Breaks when pushed, turning to drops when applicable.

These blocks may in turn push other blocks, not just the blocks in the line in front of the piston. For example, a slime block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which in turn has to push additional ground blocks in the direction of motion just as if it were being pushed directly by a piston. Glazed terracotta is an exception; it does not move when adjacent slime blocks are moved. The same occurs when a slime block is moved by an adjacent Slime Block. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of Slime Blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube. A slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. But if an adjacent block could be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the slime block is prevented from moving. Slime blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-Slime) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d73 collection of Slime Blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it. A piston cannot move itself via a \"hook\" constructed of slime blocks, but self-propelled contraptions can be created with multiple pistons. For that, see the article Tutorials/Flying machines. The same happens for the honey block, but it does not stick to slime blocks.\n\nTechnical components\n  Piston head\n    The piston head is a technical block used as the second block of an extended piston. A block state defines whether it is a normal or a sticky piston head. It can be placed using the /setblock command or with the debug stick, though if not part of a proper piston, it disappears after receiving any block tick, such as when a block is placed next to it unless the player uses the debug stick. It drops nothing. In Java Edition, the normal and sticky piston heads are distinguished by a block state. In Bedrock Edition, they use separate block IDs, and it can be obtained as an item via inventory editors. Java Edition:\n\n    Name,Default value,Allowed values,Description\n\n    facing,north,down east north south up west,The direction the piston head is pointing.\n\n    short,false,false true,\"If true, the piston arm is shorter than usual, by 4 pixels.\"\n\n    type,normal,normal sticky,The type of piston head.\n\n\n    Bedrock Edition:\nPiston Head:\n\n    Name,Metadata Bits,Default value,Allowed values,Values for Metadata Bits,Description\n\n    facing_direction,0x1 0x2 0x4,0,0 1 2 3 4 5,0 1 2 3 4 5,The direction the piston head is pointing. 0: facing up 1: facing down 2: facing south 3: facing north 4: facing east 5: facing west\n\n\n    Sticky Piston Head:\n\n    Name,Metadata Bits,Default value,Allowed values,Values for Metadata Bits,Description\n\n    facing_direction,Not Supported,0,0 1 2 3 4 5,Unsupported,The direction the piston head is pointing. 0: facing up 1: facing down 2: facing south 3: facing north 4: facing east 5: facing west\n\n\n  Moving piston\n    The moving piston, also known as block 36 due to its pre-flattening block ID, is an unobtainable technical block that contains part of a piston head, and/or part of one or two blocks that the piston is carrying into or out of the grid cell (including blocks carried indirectly via slime blocks). Since moving blocks vary in how much of each grid cell they occupy, they can't be stored as normal blocks and are instead stored as block entities. It is overwritten with air, the piston head or the carried block at the end of the piston stroke; but if it is placed through editing and no piston is connected, it remains indefinitely. It is invisible and non-solid in Java Edition, and cannot be broken without the use of commands or TNT. Although it is non-solid, fluids cannot pass through it. It also prevents players from building at its location. Mobs can see through it, but cannot walk through it.\nThe game treats the block as a stone block when it comes to the player's footstep sounds. It is similar to Invisible Bedrock in properties with the exception that the player can walk through the moving piston but not invisible bedrock.

The second batch attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of 0-37, from levels 0 to 192, being most common at Y=96, and being less common toward either end of the range. Coal ore in this second batch is also less likely to be exposed to air: 50% of ore blocks that would generate exposed do not generate. In Bedrock Edition, coal ore also has the third batches, which attempts to generate 20 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-37, evenly from levels 128 to 256, within any type of mountains biomes. Coal ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, polished andesite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], polished diorite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], polished granite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], tuff\u200c[JE  only], and deepslate. Deepslate coal ore generates when replacing tuff or deepslate, which is a rare occurrence due to the rarity of coal blobs below Y=8 where deepslate generates. Coal ore is also found in small amounts alongside underground fossils.\n\nUsage\n  Smelting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Smelting recipe\n\n    Coal,Coal Ore + Any fuel,0.1\n\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Coal ore can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

Specifically, the colony to which bone meal is applied increases in size, and any living coral block within a taxicab distance of 2 blocks (horizontally from either the coral block or the sea pickle itself) can generate 1-3 sea pickles. They do not grow or spread naturally, and do not require light. In Java Edition, sea pickles can also be created by simply bone mealing a coral block.\n\nUsage\n    Sea pickles can be placed on top of most solid blocks, as well as non-solid blocks, up to four per block, similar to turtle eggs or candles. More information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at Opacity/Placement. Sea pickles produce light when underwater. A single pickle produces a light level of 6, and a colony produces an additional 3 levels per pickle (so 4 sea pickles produces a light level of 15). When they produce light, there is a pale green glow at the end of the pickle. Bone meal can be used on sea pickles if they are underwater, and planted on living coral blocks. This increases their number on that block, and they spread to empty areas underwater above other living coral blocks. They can spread to the original sea pickle's level or one level below, out to a horizontal taxicab distance of 2.

If multiple vines exist within the same block space, breaking one of them breaks all of them instead of just the one targeted[2] and results in only a single vine dropping[3].

Jungle trees of both sizes have vines on their trunks and canopy edges, and vines grow on the sides of jungle terrain. Vines are also naturally generated on oak trees in swamps and mangrove trees. In Bedrock Edition, vines can also generate on dying oak, spruce, jungle and dark oak trees. Vines are found in jungle temples and the allium room in woodland mansions. They can also generate in watchtower walls in pillager outposts.\n\n  Trading\n    Vines are sold by wandering traders for an emerald.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Vines generate on 2\u00d72 jungle trees grown from saplings, or mangrove trees grown from propagules. In Bedrock Edition, vines generate on dying trees, which can sometimes be grown from saplings.\n\nBehavior\n    On each block tick, the vine block has a 25% chance to spread in a randomly selected direction. Their spreading can be toggled by the doVinesSpread game rule\u200c[Java Edition  only].

If the air block in the target direction has something vines could be placed on above it, spread to the top side of the air block.\nIf the block in the target direction is opaque and fills its whole cube, spread to that side of the ticked vine block. Vines cannot be grown using bone meal. Vines do not need light when growing.\n\nUsage\n    Vines can be placed on the side of any block that fills its whole cube and blocks entity movement. They can also be placed on the bottom side of a block (although not the bottom side of another vine[4]). However, a vine block without vines on any of the horizontal sides disappears if it gets an update from a neighboring block. Vines attached to the bottom of stairs are completely deleted by any block update.[5] Several vines can be placed in the same block space, as long as they are facing different directions. Vines can be climbed by standing next to them and holding the jump key. If there is a solid block behind the vines, the walk forward key can also be used. Vines cancel a sprint if the player is sprinting, slowing the movement speed. Vines absorb all fall damage, even without a solid surface nearby. Sneaking on vines causes the player to hang, even if the vines are not adjacent to any surface. Blocks can replace vines if placed within the same block space. However, item frames and paintings cannot.[6]\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Banner Pattern Bordure Indented,Paper + Vines,\"[[None, None, None], ['Paper', '', None], [None, None, None]]\",\u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ]\n\n    Mossy Cobblestone,Cobblestone + Vines,\"[[None, None, None], ['Cobblestone', '', None], [None, None, None]]\",\n\n    Mossy Stone Bricks,Stone Bricks + Vines,\"[[None, None, None], ['Stone Bricks', '', None], [None, None, None]]\",\n\n\n  Composting\n    Placing vines into a composter has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Color\n    These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

To place a powered rail, use a powered rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the powered rail should occupy. A powered rail can be placed on: A powered rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the powered rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a powered rail to the side of the fence causes the powered rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead. When placed, a powered rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including activator rails, detector rails, and other powered rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a powered rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a powered rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the powered rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a powered rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a powered rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails. Unlike their unpowered counterparts, and like detector and activator rails, powered rails are always straight. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands, which is not unintentional.[1]\n\n  Rail\n    Powered rails (and other rails) can be used as \"roads\" for minecarts. A minecart that enters a powered rail's space from either end of the powered rail continues to move in the direction the powered rail is facing, but its speed may change depending on whether the powered rail is active or not (see below). A minecart that enters a powered rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the powered rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted powered rail.\n\n  Redstone component\n    Powered rails can be used to affect the speed of minecarts that travel over them. Activation A powered rail is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by:\nan adjacent active power component (for example, a redstone torch, a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, etc.)\nan adjacent powered block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)\na powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the powered rail\npowered redstone dust configured to point at the powered rail; a powered rail is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is a directionless \"dot\" or configured to point in another direction. An activated powered rail also activates any adjacent powered rails it is connected to, up to eight away from the original activation source. Thus a single activation source can activate up to 17 rails (one original in the middle and eight on either side). An activated powered rail does not activate non-connected adjacent rails. Behavior An active powered rail:\nincreases the speed of a moving minecart in the direction it is already moving. Specifically, let the speed in both the X and Z directions (meters / tick) combined be \"speed\". If speed > 0.01, then every tick the minecart is passing over the powered rail, its x velocity is increased by (xspeed * 0.06 / speed) and its z velocity is increased by (zspeed * 0.06 / speed)\naccelerate a non-moving minecart away from a solid opaque block the powered rail is facing (so a non-moving minecart moves away from the block when the powered rail activates, and a moving minecart bounces off a block an active powered rail is facing because it stops and then gets accelerated away) An inactive powered rail reduces the speed of a moving minecart, usually stopping it within one block's distance even on a downward-slanted track. If a slanted powered rail activates with a non-moving minecart on it, the minecart starts moving downward (because it is no longer being braked by an inactive powered rail) and is then accelerated downward. Powered rails cannot increase the speed of a minecart to more than 8 blocks per second on either the north-south or east-west axis. The speeds that can be achieved with varying numbers of powered rails or intervals of normal rails between powered rails is complex -- for a thorough discussion, see Tutorials/Minecarts.\n\n  Mob interaction\n    Like other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto powered rails.\n\n",

Foliage can replace air on any of these blocks.\n\nBehavior\n    In Java Edition, all plants can be placed on moss except for cactus. Nether fungi can also be placed on moss, but mushrooms can be placed only at light level 12 or below. In Bedrock Edition, cactus, bamboo, dead bush, and sugar cane are the only plants that cannot be placed on moss. Using bone meal on moss blocks causes certain types of adjacent blocks to be replaced with moss blocks. To allow moss to spread to them, blocks need to have air above.\n\n    Block\n\n    Andesite\n\n    Cave Vines\n\n    Coarse Dirt\n\n    Deepslate\n\n    Diorite\n\n    Dirt\n\n    Granite\n\n    Grass Block\n\n    Mud \u200c [ Java Edition only ]\n\n    Mycelium\n\n    Podzol\n\n    Polished Andesite \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ]\n\n    Polished Diorite \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ]\n\n    Polished Granite \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ]\n\n    Rooted Dirt\n\n    Stone\n\n    Tuff\n\n\n    When a moss block generates with air above it, it has a chance to have grass, an azalea, or a moss carpet growing on it.\n\n    Block,Chance\n\n    Grass,52.08%\n\n    Moss Carpet,26.04%\n\n    Tall Grass,10.42%\n\n    Azalea,7.29%\n\n    Flowering Azalea,4.17%\n\n\n  Spreading specifics\n    In Java Edition, when bone meal is used on a moss block, first it is checked that the block directly above the moss block is air. If successful, maximum X and Z distances are chosen (independently from each other) with a 50% chance of being either 2 or 3. Then, in a rectangular area centered on the moss block restricted by those maximum distances, it is decided independently for each vertical column whether a block is converted to moss. This chance is 0% for the corners of the chosen area, 75% for the edges and 100% for the other columns. If this check succeeds a scan is started at a y-level one above the moss block to find a block with air above it. If the scan starts in an air block, it searches up to 6 blocks downward. If it starts in a non-air block, it searches up to 4 blocks upward. Both scans stop on the first block with air above it, even if it can not be converted to moss. The chosen block is converted to moss if it can be, and if it can (or already was a moss block) there is a 60% chance vegetation generates above it. So for every bonemeal that is used, you get on average 27 moss blocks (varies widely though), which gives about 2.5 bonemeal when put through a composter.\n\n    0%,18.75%,37.5%,37.5%,37.5%,18.75%,0%\n\n    18.75%,62.5%,87.5%,87.5%,87.5%,62.5%,18.75%\n\n    37.5%,87.5%,100%,100%,100%,87.5%,37.5%\n\n    37.5%,87.5%,100%,,100%,87.5%,37.5%\n\n    37.5%,87.5%,100%,100%,100%,87.5%,37.5%\n\n    18.75%,62.5%,87.5%,87.5%,87.5%,62.5%,18.75%\n\n    0%,18.75%,37.5%,37.5%,37.5%,18.75%,0%\n\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Moss blocks are destroyed and dropped as items when pushed by pistons.

Save\nWhen all coordinates and a structure name have been entered, press this button to save the structure.\nIn Java Edition, this saves the structure to a file. The name of the structure is the name of the file.\nStructures can be saved to a file only by manually pressing this button. If a structure block in Save mode is instead powered by redstone, the structure is saved only in memory by default. This is the case even if a file for that structure already exists on disk. Reloading the world clears any structures stored in memory. This is for unspecified security reasons.[2]\nBy default, structure blocks are saved in the minecraft namespace. This can be changed by prefixing the structure name with <namespace>: in the structure block.\nStructures are saved in .minecraft/saves/(WorldName)/generated/(namespace)/structures. [note 1]\nIn Bedrock Edition, this saves the structure into level database file rather than a standalone file. And the player can set up the structure block so that it can save into the memory or the disk (level file) when automated with redstone. Export \u200c[BE  only]\nUsed to export a structure into a .mcstructure file, which can be used to load from the structures folder of a behavior pack. If the structure contains a custom block from a behavior pack, then the block is also saved on the structure block. This option is available only on Android and Windows 10 devices.\n\n  Load\n    Load mode allows the player to load and rotate saved structures. Structure Name\nThe name of the structure to load.\nIn Java Edition, it can load structures saved to memory or a file (.minecraft/saves/<World Name>/generated/<namespace>/structures/), structures in data pack and in minecraft.jar.\nTo load a structure from a file, simply type <namespace>:<structure_path>.\nStructures saved only to memory have a higher priority than structures of the same name that were saved to a file. Structures saved to a file have a higher priority than structures of the same name that is in data pack, which have a higher priority than structures in minecraft.jar.\nIn Bedrock Edition, it can load structures saved to memory or disk (level database), and structures in behavior pack.\nStructures saved only to memory have a higher priority than structures of the same name that were saved to disk. Structures saved to disk have a higher priority than structures of the same name that is in behavior pack.\nVanilla NBT structure files cannot be loaded with structure block. Relative Position\nThe X, Y, and Z coordinates of the corner in which to generate the structure, based on the position of the structure block. Coordinates may be defined as numbers between -48 and 48 In Java Edition, or between -64 and 64 In Bedrock Edition. Show bounding box\nHighlights the outline of the structure; on by default. Structure Integrity and Seed\nRemoves random blocks that compose the structure based on a user-defined seed. Lower integrity values result in more blocks being removed. The integrity value must be between 0.0 and 1.0\u200c[JE  only] / 100.00\u200c[BE  only]. Include entities\nInclude any entities saved in the structure file when loading the structure. Off by default. Waterlog blocks \u200c[BE  only]\nWhile loading the structure in water, it allows the blocks to be waterlogged instead of being replaced with air. Remove blocks \u200c[BE  only]\nWhile loading the structure, doesn't include any blocks within saved structure. Rotation (0, 90, 180, 270)\nSets the rotation of the structure to 0\u00b0 (no rotation), 90\u00b0 clockwise, 180\u00b0 clockwise, and 270\u00b0 clockwise (or 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise). Mirror (\u00a6, <>, ^v)\nSets the mirroring of the structure to none (\u00a6), left to right (< >), or front to back (^ v). At 0\u00b0 rotation < > mirrors across the X-axis and ^ v mirrors across the Z-axis.\nIn Bedrock Edition, the options are x and z, which can be toggled to set mirroring. Animation mode \u200c[BE  only]\nSelect the animation to show how structure is loaded. Place by layer make structure loaded layer by layer, place by block make structure loaded one block by block. Default to none.\nOnce the loading has started, breaking the structure block can not stop the loading process.\nLoading with animation may break blocks in structures that contain multiple parts (such as beds, doors, or tall grass), or need to be attached to other blocks (such as torches), and may cause water, lava, and fire to spread out. Animation time \u200c[BE  only]\nAdjust the animation time for loading the structure. Load\nLoad the structure.\nIn Java Edition, press this button once to prepare the outline preview of the structure. When satisfied with the position, press again to generate the structure.\nStructures may also be loaded with the use of redstone.\n\n  Corner\n    Corner mode allows for an easier and automatic size calculation while saving or loading structures. To use, place on the opposite corner of a save structure block or a second corner structure block. Then, using a save block, press \"DETECT\".\nWhen successful, a bounding outline appears. Structure Name\nThe name of the structure on which to calculate the size and position.\nName is case sensitive; it must match exactly with the name provided by the complementary save or corner structure block.\n\n  Data\n    Data mode is a deprecated mode, which is superseded by jigsaw block, but still used in some certain vanilla structures (igloo, end city, woodland mansion, ocean ruin, shipwreck). Structure block in data mode can be used only during natural generation. They mark the location to run a specified hardcoded function, which can be used only for relevant structures.  In Java Edition, this mode is hidden unless the Alt key is held while switching from Corner mode. In Bedrock Edition, data mode structure block cannot be obtained with commands. Custom Data Tag Name\nThe name of the function to run.\nIgloo\n\"chest\" - sets the loot table for a chest beneath the structure block to \"chests/igloo_chest\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\nEnd city\n\"Chest\" - Sets the loot table for a chest beneath the structure block to \"chests/end_city_treasure\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"Sentry\" - Creates a shulker at the location of the structure block.\n\"Elytra\" - Creates an item frame entity with an elytra item inside it at the location of the structure block.\nWoodland mansion\n\"ChestSouth\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"ChestNorth\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"ChestEast\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"ChestWest\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"Mage\" - Creates an evoker at the location of the structure block.\n\"Warrior\" - Creates a vindicator at the location of the structure block.\nOcean Ruin\n\"chest\" - Creates a chest at the location of the structure block, setting its loot table to either \"chests/underwater_ruin_big\" or \"chests/underwater_ruin_small\", with seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"drowned\" - Creates a drowned at the location of the structure block.\nShipwreck\n\"map_chest\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"treasure_chest\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\"supply_chest\" - Sets the loot table for a chest that replaces the structure block to \"chests/woodland_mansion\" and sets the loot table seed dependent on the world seed.\n\n  3D Export\n    3D Export mode\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only][note 2], is similar to save mode, but the structure is saved as a 3D render in the format of .glb rather than as an actual structure.[3] Therefore, structures saved this way can be viewed with 3D Viewer[4] or Paint 3D[5], but cannot be generated via load mode. The 3D file exported is basically the same as the real-time rendering in the preview. End portal blocks, nether portal blocks, etc. in .glb file have only a static texture. Some blocks cannot be displayed properly, such as piston arms, chests, beds, etc. Including entities is not supported in this mode. Structure blocks in 3D output mode cannot be activated by redstone. Structure Name\nEnter the name of the structure. Case sensitive. The player must enter a file name in order to export. Relative Position\nEnter the X, Y, and Z values for the structure here, based on the position of the structure block. Sets the origin of the structure outline.\nMaximum allowed distance from the structure block is 64 blocks in any direction. Structure Size\nEnter the X, Y, and Z values to set the distance from the Relative Position coordinates. This sets the opposite corner of the structure, and defines its size.\nMaximum structure size is 64\u00d7256\u00d764. Remove Blocks\nWhile exporting the structure, doesn't include any blocks within saved structure. \n\n",

They can also be placed on the top and bottom of these blocks. To place on chests and doors, the player needs to be sneaking. As item frames are an entity, multiple item frames can occupy the same block, although on different faces. It also allows non-solid blocks to occupy the same space.\u200c[Java Edition  only] Players can place items in the frame by using the item. If a map is placed in an item frame, it enlarges to show the map in the size of a full block, with the item frame's location displayed as a green pointer on the map, pointing in the direction the item frame is facing. If this is done in the Nether, the green cursor spins around similar to the white cursor (players). If an item in an item frame has been renamed using an anvil, it displays its custom name when the cursor is over the item frame. If the player places a block inside the frame, it is displayed in miniature half in, half out of the block. This can be most notably seen on stairs or slabs. Pick block may be used on item frames by players in creative mode only, the control has no effect for players in Survival or Adventure mode.

Items displayed in the item frame can turn 45\u00b0 diagonally, with a total of 8 possibilities (90\u00b0 and 4 possibilities if it is a map), and the frame outputs a redstone signal depending on the rotation phase that can be interpreted by a redstone comparator (note that this rotation value is separate from the clock or compass rotation). As long as the frame remains placed, it remembers the orientation of the last item it held, and uses it for the next item it holds.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Glow item frames\n    When an item is placed inside a glow item frame, it appears to glow, even though it does not emit any light level.\n\n",

Air must be above the netherrack during this process. This transformation can also be done by activating a dispenser with bone meal directly into that netherrack block.  If both types of nylium are present, there is an equal chance of either being spread.\n\nUsage\n    Similar to grass blocks and mycelium, nylium decays (based on random ticks) into netherrack when an opaque block is placed above it. However, unlike grass blocks and mycelium, it does not decay underneath water or lava.[1] It decays when covered with snow.[2] Like mycelium and podzol, mushrooms can remain on nylium blocks in any light level. Huge mushrooms can be grown by using bone meal on mushrooms planted on nylium. Fungi can likewise be grown into huge fungi using bone meal, though the fungus must be placed on the same type of nylium, or the bone meal will not even be consumed. Similar to grass blocks, the player can apply bone meal to nylium. This nylium, along with nearby nylium, generate vegetation that occurs in their native biome (crimson nylium generates mostly crimson forest vegetation and warped nylium generates mostly warped forest vegetation), and just like in the native biomes, the opposite type of fungi occassionally generates. The vegetation is generated in a 5\u00d75 area, centered on the nylium block on which bone meal is used.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Nylium can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

It observes the block that it is placed against. The texture of the detecting side is that of an observing face. As observers can detect the state of other observers, placing two adjacent observers, each watching the other, can make a fast and compact redstone clock. They send out a pulse.\n\n  Behavior\n    In Java Edition, an observer detects changes in its target's block states, or the breaking or placing of a block (i.e. changes in its block state, but not its block entity data). This means that changes like the age of crops can be detected because they are part of the block states. In Bedrock Edition, an observer acts as a block update detector and detects anything that causes a block update. The causes and propagation of block updates are different between Java Edition and Bedrock Edition. As a result, each can detect some kinds of changes that the other cannot. See the table below for a comparison. When it detects something, the observer emits a redstone pulse of strong power at level 15 for 2 game ticks (1 redstone tick). The pulse can power redstone dust, a redstone comparator, a redstone repeater, or any mechanism component located at its opposite end. In Java Edition, the pulse is emitted with a delay of 1 redstone tick. In Bedrock Edition, it is supposed to be delayed by 1 tick as well but is actually delayed 2 redstone ticks due to MCPE-15793, a bug causing redstone delays to be incorrect when components are activated by world changes (which, in the case of the observer in Bedrock Edition, is the only way it can be activated), as opposed to pure redstone components ticking. Its timing can also be incorrect due to MCPE-73342. It also counts as a block update when the observer itself is moved by a piston. When this happens, an observer emits a pulse after being pushed or pulled, but not beforehand. This enables them to be used in flying machines. Observers behave as both opaque and transparent blocks: they block light and allow mob spawning on top, but do not block opening chests below, do not cut off redstone wire, and cannot conduct redstone power. Because observers in Java Edition detect changes in the block state, and not block updates, they can detect a wider range of phenomena than a block update detector (BUD) circuit in Bedrock Edition can detect (as some block state changes don't cause block updates). Observers in Bedrock Edition do detect block updates but not block state changes, and so they detect the exact same things that any other BUD would detect in that edition.\n\n  Limitations\n    Change in block state,Detected in\n\n    Bedrock Edition,Java Edition\n\n    \"A block or a fluid being placed or broken in any way; either directly by player , enderman , or ravager or through: Placing/breaking two-block-tall/wide blocks Snow golem or snowfall creating snow Snow melting Dispenser placing carved pumpkin , wither skull , or shulker box Creating/removing fluid using player or dispenser Placing scaffolding on top/side of another scaffolding Entities on fire touching powder snow , causing it to melt Block being broken by fluid, (sticky) piston , explosion , or opacity , [1] Inconsonant light level [2] [3] Flammable blocks getting burned up by fire or lava A falling block turn into a falling block entity and vice versa Cactus breaking by placing a solid block next to it Villager planting and destroying crops Zombie breaking doors Leaves decaying Chorus plant break due to their invaild placement [4] Using up a damaged anvil , causing the damaged anvil to break Eating all the cake Water touching a sponge , causing the area near the sponge to be removed and create a block update to the water Place the block into the replaceable block, replace a block by left-clicking and right-clicking at the same time; A wither rose block being planted after wither kills a mob if the ground is grass block , dirt , coarse dirt , moss block , mud , soul sand , soul soil \u200c [ JE only ] or netherrack Left-clicking the dragon egg , causing it to teleport and create a block update at the starting teleporting point and the teleporting destination of the dragon egg Boat and boat with chest breaking a lily pad Turtle laying turtle egg (s), trampling an eggs=1 turtle egg or turtle egg(s) hatching into baby turtle(s) Damaging a silverfish , causing a nearby infested block turn into silverfish and create a block update Frog laying frogspawn or frogspawn hatch into tadpole Thrown trident breaks pointed dripstone Sniffer egg hatch into snifflet The upper part of pitcher crop spawn when apply bone meal on the pitcher crop that have block state age is 2\",Yes,Yes\n\n    Water being inserted to or removed from a block that can be waterlogged .,Yes,Yes\n\n    \"A water (or lava , if lavaSourceConversion is set to true \u200c [ JE only ] ) source block being created by having 2 water source blocks unite to each other.\",Yes,Yes\n\n    \"Fire being ignited or extinguished in any way; either directly by player or through: A dispenser Fire spreading to flammable blocks next to lava or fire Fireball from a dispenser, a ghast or a blaze Lightning A bed or a respawn anchor exploding Place an end crystal on bedrock or obsidian in the End Being extinguished by fluid , splash water bottle , lingering water bottle or naturally\",Yes,Yes\n\n    A fire is turned into a soul fire (but not vice versa).,Yes,Yes\n\n    \"Fluid or powder snow being placed in or removed from a cauldron or the level of the water /lava/powder snow cauldron changing in any way, for example using bucket (empty, water, lava , powder snow), bottle , water bottle , rain , snowfall , pointed dripstone , burning entity on water/powder snow cauldron.\",Yes,Yes\n\n    \"A block being replaced by / setblock , / fill or / clone commands.\",Yes,Yes\n\n    Change block state of block using debug stick .\u200c [ Java Edition only ],N/A,No\n\n    A nether portal being created.,Yes,No [5]\n\n    A nether portal being destroyed.,No [6],Yes\n\n    An end portal being created.,No,No\n\n    An end portal being destroyed.,No,Yes\n\n    \"The creation of an iron golem , a snow golem or a wither .\",Yes,Yes\n\n    A (sticky) piston (head) extending or retracting.,Yes,Yes\n\n    A block being pushed or pulled by a (sticky) piston ; either directly or stuck to slime block or honey block moved by the piston.

They are used as a crafting ingredient, to feed llamas, horses and horse variants, reduce fall damage or extend campfire smoke.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Hay bales can be mined using any tool, but a hoe speeds up the process.\n\n    Block,Hay Bale\n\n    Hardness,0.5\n\n    Tool,Hoe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.75\n\n    Wooden,0.4\n\n    Stone,0.2\n\n    Iron,0.15\n\n    Diamond,0.1\n\n    Netherite,0.1\n\n    Golden,0.1\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Hay bales often generate as pile (and in some houses, animal pens, farms, or meeting points) scattered around in plains villages, and less commonly in savanna and desert villages. They also can generate under some campfires in taiga villages and as a part of targets/scarecrows in pillager outposts.\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Wheat,\"[['Wheat', 'Wheat', 'Wheat'], ['Wheat', 'Wheat', 'Wheat'], ['Wheat', 'Wheat', 'Wheat']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n    Hay bales can be used as compact storage of wheat.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Target,Redstone Dust + Hay Bale,\"[[None, 'Redstone Dust', None], ['Redstone Dust', '', 'Redstone Dust'], [None, 'Redstone Dust', None]]\"\n\n    Wheat,Hay Bale,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Food item\n    Although players cannot eat hay bales, hay bales serve as a compact wheat supply for crafting food items during long periods away from other food sources. A full stack of 64 hay bales is equivalent to 192 loaves of bread in a single inventory slot.\n\n  Animals\n    Hay bales can be fed to donkeys, horses, llamas, or mules to heal up to 10 hearts. They are an effective method to heal horses if the player wants to heal them in a short period of time. They also speed up the growth of foals by three minutes and baby llamas by 90 seconds.\n\n  Breeding\n    Hay bales can be used both to lead and breed horses and llamas.\n\n  Falling\n    Falling onto a hay bale reduces the fall damage by 80%, meaning whatever falls on a hay bale takes 20% of the normal fall damage. Below are some example damages a player receives falling on a hay bale (assuming no fall damage reducing enchantments and/or status effects).\n\n    Fall height,Fall Damage\n\n    4-8 blocks,1\n\n    9-13 blocks,2\n\n    95-100 blocks,19 \u00d7 9.5\n\n    101-103 blocks,20 \u00d7 10\n\n    115-120 blocks,23 \u00d7 11.5\n\n\n    So it is possible to fall onto a hay bale and survive a 100 block fall (starting with full health) or even a 120 block fall (starting with full health plus 2 absorption hearts).\n\n  Campfires\n    Placing a hay bale under a campfire makes it a signal fire, increasing the height to which its smoke particles can rise from 10 blocks to 25 blocks.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a hay bale into a composter has an 85% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Composting with hay bales is very inefficient, as the hay bale's chance to be composted is only slightly higher than wheat. For example, 900 wheat could be composted to yield 834\u20447 bone meal on average, but if crafted into 100 hay bales, they would only yield 121\u20447 bone meal on average\n\n  Placement\n    Hay bales can be placed pointing in all three spatial dimensions, in the same way as a log is placed. However, there is no \"six-sided\" variant like that of the wood block.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Hay bale can be placed under note blocks to produce banjo sounds.\n\n",

The new primed TNT is spawned at the center (+0.5,+0.5,+0.5) of where the TNT block was, like a cube with an edge length of 0.98. Its fuse lasts 40 redstone ticks (4 seconds/80 game ticks) if activated by redstone or fire, or a random number between 10 and 30 game ticks (0.5 to 1.5 seconds) if it is destroyed by another explosion. Once spawned, primed TNT is given a vertical velocity of 0.2\u00a0blocks per tick, and a horizontal velocity of 0.02\u00a0blocks per tick in a random direction. Given these velocities, the TNT travels 0.166 blocks (or 6 block pixels) horizontally before it stops, given there is no block in the way. When the countdown timer expires, the TNT explodes. If in the air, TNT falls roughly 77 blocks before exploding once it is ignited. The explosion has an explosive power of 4.[more information needed] In Java Edition destroyed blocks have an 100% rate of dropping as items, unlike other explosions; in Bedrock Edition blocks have a chance of being destroyed as usual. Primed TNT's texture blinks, alternating every 0.5 seconds between the TNT block's texture, and a copy of it that has been brightened to near-white. The effect is dynamic and the brightened texture can't be found in the assets. Primed TNT cannot be pushed by players or other mobs, but it moves when in flowing water or lava. Primed TNT cannot mount minecarts or boats. When primed TNT detonates while in water or lava, it does not break any blocks. It does still damage players, mobs, and other entities.\u200c[Java Edition  only][1] Primed TNT that detonates outside water can still damage submerged blocks. To make TNT destroy blocks in the water, e.g. to enter an ocean monument from the top, one can place sand or gravel on the TNT before it is primed. Priming the TNT causes the sand or gravel to fall one block, engulfing the TNT. Because the TNT is no longer immersed in water, it can destroy the surrounding blocks. Primed TNT is not teleported when entering a nether portal; instead, it passes through portal blocks.\u200c[Java Edition  only] Primed TNT teleports as expected when entering an end portal, maintaining its direction and speed. The fuse timer keeps counting down (unless the spawn chunks are unloaded, then it pauses until a player loads the chunks). If the TNT is primed atop any sort of fence post that is two blocks high or larger, it falls through the fence block on which it was activated and stops on the next lower one. Its detonation damages only the fence block it was \"stuck\" in. In Java Edition primed TNT summoned by a command explodes immediately because the fuse time defaults to zero if not specified.\n\n  Redstone component\n    For redstone to activate TNT, it must either lead directly to the TNT, or power an adjacent block.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Minecart with TNT,TNT + Minecart,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Minecart', None], [None, None, None]]\",\n\n    Underwater TNT,Sodium + TNT,\"[[None, 'Sodium', None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\",\u200c [ Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education only ]\n\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    The dragon egg is a decorative block or a \"trophy item\", and is the rarest item obtainable in the game, as it generates only once (or twice in Bedrock Edition[1]) per world.\n\nObtaining\n    Across both Java and Bedrock editions, the dragon egg is available in the Creative inventory. It can be obtained with pick block or the /give command, or placed in the world with commands such as /setblock and /fill.\n\n  Breaking\n    The dragon egg usually cannot be mined directly, as trying to do so causes it to teleport within a 31\u00d715\u00d731 volume centered on the egg, with locations toward the center more likely. If all air blocks in that area are filled so there is nowhere for the egg to teleport to, or if it fails to find an air block after 1,000 attempts at teleporting, it can be mined. The dragon egg is a gravity-affected block, and drops as an item when pushed by a piston or when it falls onto a block less than a full block tall, such as a torch or a bottom slab. When destroyed by an explosion, the block always drops as an item. The dragon egg is not immune to destruction by the ender dragon, despite being produced by it.[2]\n\n    Block,Dragon Egg\n\n    Hardness,3\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,4.5\n\n\n  Post-generation\n    In Java Edition, a single dragon egg is generated on top of the exit portal when the first ender dragon is defeated. In Bedrock Edition, two dragon eggs generate on top of the exit portal; one generates when the first ender dragon is defeated, while the other generates when the second ender dragon is defeated.[1]\n\nUsage\n    The dragon egg, if there is no block below it, falls until it lands on the next available block. When it is being affected by gravity and falling, it exhibits a smooth falling animation. It does not suffocate mobs or players when it falls and covers them, nor does it crush mobs or players like anvils and stalactites do. The dragon egg can be placed on a non-solid block without falling. Like other falling blocks, when the dragon egg is floating, it has black particles falling from it.\n\n  Light source\n    The dragon egg emits a light level of 1.\n\n  Teleporting\n    To cause the egg to teleport, press attack while in Survival or Adventure mode (press use in Creative). It teleports to an air block nearby (up to seven blocks vertically and fifteen blocks horizontally), creating the same particles as an enderman. It may teleport into the air and subsequently fall to the ground since it forcefully obeys gravity. If all available air blocks are filled, it is possible to break the block. Dragon egg teleportation lacks teleportation sounds.[3]\n\n  The Void\n    In the case that egg teleportation finds an invalid location such as a negative y value, it makes an additional attempt to find a valid location, centered on the invalid location rather than the original position.\n\n",

A sequence of rails (including regular rails, activator rails, detector rails, and powered rails) is called a track.\n\n  Placement\n    To place a rail, use a rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the rail should occupy. A rail can be placed on: Rails visually float 1\u204416 blocks above the ground, with an outline 2\u204416 blocks high. A rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a rail to the side of the fence causes the rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead. More information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at Opacity/Placement. A placed rail configures itself to be straight or curved according to rail blocks around it. Existing tracks one block up and down are considered for adjacency in the same manner, and the new piece of track gets laid as a curve, but unless space is left for sloping track sections, minecarts can continue past the curve only on level or one-block-down corners. In one-block-up corners, the cart ends up buried in the ground. Some placement of rails produces track layouts that cause minecarts to collide and enter blocks. Existing sections of track may be re-oriented, become sloping, or even change into curved sections when the new rail is placed adjacent to it: Rails can be pushed and pulled by pistons. Pushing a rail upwards may cause adjacent rails to become slanted. Subsequently pulling the rail back down again will cause those newly-slanted rails to break because they are no longer supported on their upper end.\n\n  Redstone component\n    The intersection rail at a T-intersection may be made to change its direction of curvature by applying redstone power using a redstone torch, lever, or button. Separate tracks are laid adjacent, but at the next level, lower or higher can sometimes cause issues. However, normally they do not interact with the switched rail.\n\n  Minecart behavior\n    A minecart travels straight through a T-shaped intersection when entering from the \"back of\" the curved rail. It follows the curve when entering from either of the other two legs. A minecart passes straight through a 4-way intersection constructed to have no curved rail. When entering the 4-way from east or west a cart turns according to the south-east rule. At non-curve track intersections, minecarts always travel downhill if they can. This is known as the downhill rule and overrides the south-east rule. A block placed above the track at the downhill end of a ramp prevents minecarts from traveling down the slope, but not up. For a minecart to move down a diagonal tunnel, there must be clearance sufficient for a player to walk it. If a straight track piece leads to a curve block and isn't attached to the curve, a minecart runs over the gap and continues to go straight over the curve. This is not applicable to other types of rails. Notably, the minecart can exceed the normal 8\u00a0m/s speed limit while it jumps over the gap. For example, by placing intersections on every other block of a straight track, it is possible to travel (uncomfortably) at 10\u00a0m/s in a straight direction. As with straight T-intersections and 4-way intersections, the practice of making a minecart jump track can be used to make one-way entries onto a track. On curve intersections the behavior is more intuitive because the cart simply proceeds in the direction it is already going, allowing designs that don't rely on knowledge of the south-east rule. A minecart with no rider at full speed can climb 10 blocks on an unpowered track. This suggests that a powered track is needed at a height of only 10 blocks to keep a cart climbing. However, the cart slows so much that it can reach only another 5 blocks high with 2 lengths of powered track starting at 9 blocks high. The minimum number of powered rails to keep the cart climbing perpetually is 3 every 6 blocks. Carts with a rider, or minecarts with chests, have more momentum and so climb higher than carts that are unloaded. With a rider, a minecart can climb at least 24 blocks before needing powered rails to go higher. Also, to ascend from 0 to max speed, the player needs 7 powered rails.\n\n  Mob behavior\n    In Java Edition, most mobs avoid walking on rails,[1] but they ignore rails when they are already on them. Jumping mobs like slimes, frogs[2], and goats can jump onto rails, but frogs and goats do not walk onto rails. Aquatic creatures like guardians, tadpoles, and fish that flop around on land can flop onto rails. Parrots can land on rails and endermen can teleport onto rails, although they do not walk onto them. In pursuit of their targets, Zombies may push other mobs onto the rails in which case the mob on the rail will ignore rails as long as they are on them. The only mobs that freely walk onto rails are spiders, cave spiders, and wardens. In Bedrock Edition, rails don't affect mob pathfinding in any way.\n\n",

Otherwise, they drop nothing. Unless the pickaxe is enchanted with Silk Touch, the ender chest drops only 8 obsidian with no eyes of ender.

If a solid block is placed above an ender chest, it cannot be opened. Ender chests can be used like normal chests, except all ender chests in the world are interconnected, including in different dimensions. The ender chest's inventory is also separate for each player; consequently, items stored in an ender chest cannot be seen or taken by other players. Also, items stored inside of an ender chest retain even if the player dies. Even if every single ender chest is destroyed in the world, the items inside the ender chest are still secure, and can be retrieved by placing another ender chest. Because of this player-specific property, ender chests are extremely useful on multiplayer servers to secure player's most valuable items. Donkeys, mules, and llamas cannot be equipped with ender chests; they support only normal chests. Ender chests contain 27 slots for storage and can be placed next to other ender chests without joining; they cannot be combined into double chests. It is possible to greatly increase the space of an ender chest by pairing it with shulker boxes (i.e. filling the shulker boxes with desired items, then placing them inside the ender chest). Placing 27 shulker boxes in the ender chest will increase the storage space to 729 slots. Ender chests do not interact with hoppers, droppers, or comparators. Despite being comprised largely of obsidian, they are not immune to destruction by the ender dragon.[2]\n\n  Light source\n    Ender chests emit a light level of 7.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Ender chests can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins become hostile toward players who open or mine an ender chest.[3]\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Ender chests cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by sticky pistons.\n\n",

In order for this to work, there must be 2 water blocks above the block the bone meal is being used on, and the lower one must be non-flowing water. This does not work in Bedrock Edition, due to MCPE-171383.\n\nUsage\n    The seagrass item can be placed only on non-transparent blocks. It breaks when non-transparent blocks move into its hitbox. Like grass, snow layers, and other such blocks, placing blocks inside seagrass deletes the seagrass. However, seagrass prevents coral fan placement.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only][3] Tall seagrass has a hitbox considerably more appropriate for its size than other two-block-tall plants such as tall grass.[4] Seagrass is completely resistant to lava trying to flow into it, allowing for lava to be floating on top of the water.[5]\n\n  Breeding\n    Seagrass can be used to lead and breed turtles.\n\n  Bone meal\n    Applying bone meal to a regular seagrass transforms it to tall seagrass if there is enough space. The bone meal is wasted if insufficient space exists.[6]\n\n  Composting\n    Placing seagrass into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Growing turtles\n    Using seagrass on a baby turtle accelerates its growing time. When the turtle becomes an adult, it drops one scute.\n\n",

They fill with honey as bees pollinate flowers and return to their homes and, when full, can either be sheared for honeycombs or honey bottles extracted using glass bottles.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Beehives and bee nests can be broken by any tool or by the player's fist, though they break faster with an axe. If a bee nest is broken with a tool not enchanted with Silk Touch, it drops nothing and any bees inside or nearby emerge angry at the player. If a Silk Touch tool is used, the bee nest drops itself and any bees inside remain inside, and any bees nearby will not become angry. Beehives are much like the bee nest, but will drop an empty beehive when broken without silk touch instead of nothing. If broken in Creative mode with bees inside, the beehive or nest drops itself and bees inside remain inside.\n\n    Block,Bee Nest,Beehive\n\n    Hardness,0.3,0.6\n\n    Tool,Axe,Axe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.45,0.9\n\n    Wooden,0.25,0.45\n\n    Stone,0.15,0.25\n\n    Iron,0.1,0.15\n\n    Diamond,0.1,0.15\n\n    Netherite,0.05,0.1\n\n    Golden,0.05,0.1\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Naturally generated bee nests generate with 3 bees in them. The bee nests always face south. Bee nests generate in the following biomes with different chances:\n\n    Biome,Chance [note 1]\n\n    JE,BE\n\n    Meadow,100%\n\n    Cherry Grove,5%,Unknown\n\n    Plains Sunflower plains,5%\n\n    Mangrove Swamp,5%,4%\n\n    Flower forest,2%,3%\n\n    Forest Birch forest Old growth birch forest,0.2%,0.035%\n\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Any Planks + Honeycomb,\"[['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks'], ['Honeycomb', 'Honeycomb', 'Honeycomb'], ['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks']]\"\n\n\n    Beehives can be crafted in a crafting table. Bee nests occur naturally and cannot be crafted.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Oak, birch, mangrove, or cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks (including diagonally) of a flower on the same y-level have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 1\u20133 bees. This holds true in any biome in any dimension, and for any flower including wither roses and flowering azaleas.\n\nUsage\n  Bee housing\n    Bee nests and beehives can house up to 3 bees at a time. They can enter through any unobstructed side, top, or bottom, but can exit only from the front, and only if it's unobstructed by a solid block (including a non-full solid block in Bedrock Edition). Bees fly into a nest or hive at night, during rain, and after loading up with pollen from a flower. They first look for one at the same coordinates as the last one they entered, but if there's no nest or hive there or it already contains 3 bees when they arrive, they search the nearby area for another one. Igniting a nest or hive allows any bees inside to escape, possibly catching fire as they flee.\n\n  Harvesting\n    Once full, bee nests and beehives provide two harvestable products: honey and honeycomb. Each time a bee enters a nest or hive covered in pollen, it starts converting it to honey and honeycomb. After it's done, it waits for daylight with no rain (if necessary), then exits to go collect more pollen. When the bee exits, the hive increments its honey level by 1 and has a 1% chance to increment it by 2. Once it has the maximum honey level of 5, it changes its appearance to show honey oozing out and, if the block below it isn't a full solid block, starts dripping honey particles. (The dripping honey is decorative; it cannot be collected in a cauldron.) These changes signal that the hive or nest is ready for harvesting. To harvest honey, the player uses a glass bottle on the nest or hive; the bottle then becomes a honey bottle. To harvest honeycomb, the player uses shears on the nest or hive, causing it to drop three honeycomb items. After harvesting, the hive or nest is reset to empty (honey level 0, with the default appearance). Alternatively, honey or honeycomb can be harvested by powering a redstone dispenser containing either a glass bottle or shears. The dispenser must be placed beside and facing the hive or nest. Harvesting from a beehive or bee nest causes any bees inside it to become aggravated toward the player, unless there is a fire directly beneath it or a lit campfire within five blocks below, and the smoke is not obstructed. Smoke can pass through no more than one solid block, and only if that block is directly above the campfire. Placing a carpet above the campfire leaves room for the bees to hover beneath the nest and still avoid taking fire damage. In Java Edition, the smoke coming through the carpet also calms the bees. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet is treated as an obstruction that removes the calming effect of the campfire's smoke. Without a block covering the fire, the bees can still avoid fire damage if the campfire is placed 4\u20135 blocks below the nest.\n\n  Redstone component\n    Beehives and bee nests have comparator output with a strength equal to the honey level in the block. Once the beehive or bee nest is filled with honey it emits a signal strength of five.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Beehives and bee nests can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sound.\n\n  Fuel\n    In Bedrock Edition, beehives and bee nests can be used as fuel in a furnace, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\n",

The frames generate in a 5\u00d75 square formation, with 3 frames on each side, without the corners. Each end portal frame generates facing inward, with a 10% chance of containing an eye of ender. Each stronghold contains an end portal in Java Edition, while in Bedrock Edition only some strongholds have a portal.[1][more information needed] In Java Edition, each world contains exactly 128 strongholds, so a total of 1,536 end portal frames are generated. In Bedrock Edition, there is an unlimited amount of strongholds in each world, so the amount of end portal frames that may generate is unlimited. In Legacy Console Edition, there was only one end portal per world, so 12 end portal frames were generated. There is an extremely low chance (10-12 or 10-10% or one in a trillion) for all twelve end portal frames to be filled in strongholds.

While fungi of both types and other Nether vegetation do generate this way, they are more likely to be the same type as the nylium.[1]\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Fungi may be placed on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, podzol, farmland, rooted dirt, moss blocks, nylium, mycelium, soul soil, mud, and muddy mangrove roots. Attempting to place it on any other block fails. Fungi requires a solid block underneath it, and pops off and drops itself if it is no longer supported. Fungi can also be placed in flower pots.\n\n  Growth\n    When bone meal is used on a fungus that is planted on matching nylium, it has a 40% chance to grow into its tall equivalent (similar to saplings and mushrooms). Crimson and warped fungi grow into crimson and warped huge fungi, respectively. The stem, shroomlight, or nether wart block may replace certain blocks including slabs and torches.\n\n  Breeding\n    Crimson fungus can be used to breed hoglins and keep them from despawning, but it does not stop the hoglin from attacking the player. Warped fungus can be used to breed striders and lead them around if crafted as a warped fungus on a stick.\n\n  Hoglins\n    All hoglins, regardless of age, avoid and run up to 7 blocks away from warped fungus when it is placed on a block or inside of a flower pot.

After being placed, it goes through four stages of growth. When fully grown it can be broken to produce beetroot seeds and beetroots. While beetroot crops have only four growth stages compared to eight for wheat, carrots, and potatoes, each growth tick has a 1\u20443 chance of not advancing the growth stage and therefore beetroot grows slightly faster than other crops. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. One application of bonemeal has a 75% chance of advancing growth by one stage. This is less effective than for other crops: an average of 5\u00a01\u20443 are needed to fully grow beetroot compared to 2\u00a02\u20447 for other crops.\n\n  Breeding\n    Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\n\n  Taming\n    Like other seeds, beetroot seeds can be used to tame parrots.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing beetroot seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders may offer to sell beetroot seeds for one emerald.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A cobweb is a block that slows down entity movements.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Cobwebs can be obtained as an item using shears.[a] A cobweb drops one piece of string if broken with a sword, or if water touches or flows over it, or a piston pushes it. It drops nothing when broken using anything else, or if lava flows over it.\n\n    Block,Cobweb\n\n    Hardness,4\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,20\n\n    Shears,0.4\n\n    Sword,0.4\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Cobwebs generate naturally in mineshafts, stronghold libraries, igloo basements, abandoned villages and woodland mansion spider spawner rooms.\n\nUsage\n    Mobs can spawn inside of cobwebs, in which case they do not catch fire if they are caught in a cobweb. Cobwebs also diffuse sky light. Blocks can be placed on cobwebs. Paintings\u200c[Java Edition  only] and signs can be placed on their sides, or on top in the case of signs. Despite being slowed down by them, mobs do not try to pathfind around cobwebs, which can be exploited to construct clever mob traps. They can be useful in PvP servers, where a player can quickly erect a barrier of cobwebs that can trap players, or force them to destroy the cobwebs. They are also useful in traps that are deliberately intended to troll players, such as a long pitfall with cobwebs and lava at the bottom.\n\n  Redstone circuits\n    Cobwebs can be used as a delaying mechanism in a redstone circuit, for example, to delay an item falling on a pressure plate or into a hopper. They can also be used to cancel random momentum of an item thrown from a dispenser or dropper by placing them directly on their face.\n\n  Effects\n    All mobs except for spiders and cave spiders experience slow movement through a cobweb. A mob falling through a cobweb takes 13 seconds to move down 1 block. A cobweb can partially stop blast damage if a player and the entity causing the explosion are both caught in the cobweb. The slowing effect of the cobweb increases if it is placed on ice. \nThe slowest a player can move in vanilla Minecraft without commands or other third-party tools is by placing cobwebs on Blue Ice, sneaking, drinking a level IV Turtle Master Potion, and blocking, which causes the player come to a near-total standstill, moving only a single block every few minutes. A cobweb affects the player's movement abilities, as well. While in contact with it, the player can move at a speed of about 15% of the normal walking speed. Additionally, jumping vibrates the player akin to jumping in a 2-block-high space.\u200c[Java Edition  only] A cobweb also limits the rate at which a player can break blocks. Like water, falling into a cobweb prevents a player from taking fall damage, meaning a fatal fall can be mitigated with cobwebs. Attacking while falling through cobwebs counts as a critical hit, the same as when falling after a jump. Items thrown into a cobweb are slowed and fall through it after a maximum of about 24 seconds depending on where it enters. They do not merge with other items of the same type thrown on the ground. Cobwebs have different effects on moving entities. A falling block that enters a cobweb slows down, then drops as an item after existing for 30 seconds.\u200c[Java Edition  only] An arrow shot at a cobweb passes through without being slowed. A minecart with no players in it takes about 9 seconds to fall through a cobweb if a rail is placed directly under the cobweb, however, if there is air between the cobweb and the rail, the minecart takes about 34 seconds to fall. Every extra cobweb added gives an additional 25 seconds of falling time. Players are unaffected by cobwebs when in a minecart unless they come into direct contact. Cobwebs can be placed before a fall to prevent fall damage.\n\n",

                {
                    "context": "Overview\n    A head or skull is a block modeled after the head of a specific entity. There are seven types of heads: player (Steve's head by default), zombie, skeleton, wither skeleton, creeper, piglin, and dragon.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    A mob head can be mined using any item,[1] and drops itself when broken.\n\n    Block,Mob Head\n\n    Hardness,1\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,1.5\n\n\n    If a head is pushed by a piston or comes in contact with water or lava, it breaks off as an item. When destroyed by an explosion, the head always drops as an item.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Dragon heads generate on end ships found in end cities. Skeleton skulls can generate in ancient cities, which sometimes generate in the deep dark.\n\n  Mob loot\n    A wither skeleton has a 2.5% chance of dropping a wither skeleton skull when killed by a player or a tamed wolf. The chance is increased by 1% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 5.5% with Looting III. In Bedrock Edition, the chance is increased by 2% per level of Looting, for a maximum of 8.5% with Looting III. Skeleton, wither skeleton, zombie, creeper and piglin heads are always dropped by the respective mob if it dies due to a charged creeper's explosion. In Bedrock Edition, if multiple mobs are killed by the same charged creeper, all of them drop their heads, however in Java Edition only one mob selected at random drops its head.[2] If an ender dragon or a player is killed by a charged creeper, it does not drop its head.[3]\n\nUsage\n  Decoration\n    Mob heads can be oriented in 16 different directions on top of a block, and 4 directions on the sides of blocks, similar to signs. They can be placed on top of, or beside each other by shift clicking. When placed and powered by redstone, the piglin and dragon heads plays an animation. The piglin head flaps its ears (2 times per second for the right ear and 2.5 times per second for the left ear) while the dragon head opens and closes its mouth repeatedly (2 times per second). The same animation occurs when worn by a (horizontally) moving player, zombie, skeleton, or armor stand (note: the animation does not play if the NoGravity tag is set to 1)\n\n  Wearing\n    The player can wear heads, similarly to pumpkins or helmets. This overlays the second layer of the player's skin. Wearing the corresponding mob head reduces the detection range for skeletons (but not wither skeletons), creepers, zombies, and piglins to 50% of the normal range. This is similar to (and stacks with) the reductions in detection range from sneaking and from the Invisibility status effect. In Bedrock Edition, wearing any mob head or carved pumpkin makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.\n\n  Withers\n    Withers can be spawned by placing soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the T. The T can be horizontal or vertical. The last block placed must be one of the three wither skeleton skulls. A dispenser can also create a wither, by placing the final skull onto soul sand directly in front of and below it.\n\n  Dispensers\n    A dispenser can equip a mob head on a player, mob, or armor stand with an empty helmet slot, within the block the dispenser is facing. Dispensers can also complete the construction of a wither.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Banner Pattern Creeper,Paper + Creeper Head,\"[[None, None, None], ['Paper', 'Creeper Head', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n    Banner Pattern Skull,Paper + Wither Skeleton Skull,\"[[None, None, None], ['Paper', 'Wither Skeleton Skull', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n    Firework Star,Any Mob head + Gunpowder + Any Dye,\"[[None, None, None], ['Gunpowder', 'Wither Skeleton Skull', None], [None, 'White Dye', None]]\"\n\n\n  Enchantments\n    Mob heads can receive the following enchantments, but only through an anvil.\n\n    Name,Max Level,Method\n\n    Curse of Binding,I,\n\n    Curse of Vanishing,I,\n\n\n  Note blocks\n    Placing a head above a note block causes the note block to play the corresponding mob's ambient sound when activated. The only exception is the creeper head; as creepers don't make ambient sounds, the note block plays the primed (hissing) sound instead. The block below the note block does not affect the mob sound it creates.\n\nPlayer skins\n    Human heads have an extra usage for map makers, they can be given NBT data so that they appear with the skin of any Minecraft account. This means if a player knows that a specific account has a head that is desired to display, the NBT data can be edited to make it appear. The command to give the player a head with the skin of another player is /give @s minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:\"<PlayerName>\"}. Commonly, this kind of head is called a custom head. Another command to give the player a head with another player's skin is /give @s minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:{Id:\"<PlayerUUID>\",Properties:{textures:[{Value:\"<SkinURL>\"}]} } }. SkinURL is a string encoded in Base64 containing the URL of the player's skin.[4] A player head saves the skin of the player from the time it was created, meaning if the player changes their skin, the head still displays the original texture.[5] This kind of head is generally called a custom head. Note that it is therefore necessary to be connected to the internet to load the texture of a skin, whatever the property used.\nWhen they are loaded for the first time by the client, the skins textures are cached in .minecraft\\assets\\skins\\(subfolders)\\(files).\nIf the client does not have access to the internet when it first loads, the player's head displays a regular head (Steve's skin) which is also cached.\nAfterwards, even if the client reconnects to the internet, in order to display the skin correctly, it is necessary to clear the cache manually by deleting the recently created files in .minecraft\\assets\\skins\\(subfolder), then restarting the game.\n\n  Marc's Head Format\n    Marc Watson created a number of accounts with specific skins so map makers could use common heads without the risk of someone changing their skins.[6] Nowadays, since heads do not update the skin if a player changes their skin, this is not something map-makers need to worry about, though these skins are still useful. These accounts have names in the format MHF_<Name>, for example MHF_PigZombie is the name of a Minecraft user with a zombified piglin head. MHF stands for \"Marc's Head Format\".[7] There are also a few blocks and \"bonus\" heads, for more variety. These player heads have not been updated in compliance with the Texture Update, and are outdated. Because these are names of player accounts, these heads are obtained or placed using the SkullOwner tag, for instance: /give @s minecraft:player_head{SkullOwner:\"MHF_<Name>\"}.

As a result, dandelions can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds. Natural dandelions are found in plains and savanna villages. Potted dandelions can also generate in woodland mansions.\n\n  Post-generation\n    When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above (except those marked as \u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]), dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15\u00d75\u00d715 area. When bone meal is applied to a grass block in any biome except swamp, dandelions have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7\u00d75\u00d77 area. When bone meal is applied to a dandelion that has been placed on top of a grass block, more dandelions appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Poppies can also occasionally appear, and dandelions can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to poppies. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7\u00d77 square.\n\n  Mob loot\n    Endermen can pick up dandelions, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Dandelion,Village,Plains\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1,\"22.8% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Dandelion\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 1, \"\"chance\"\": 0.22790559614142292, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Plains house chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bedrock Edition\n\n    Dandelion,Village,Plains\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1,\"22.8% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Dandelion\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 1, \"\"chance\"\": 0.22790559614142292, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Plains house chest\"\" }\"\n\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders may sell a dandelion for a single emerald.\n\nUsage\n    Like other flowers, dandelions can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.

Signs are also not destroyed by water or lava and therefore may be used to control the flow of these fluids.\n\n  Placement\n    Signs may be placed on the top or side of other blocks (including semi-solid and non-solid blocks such as fences, trapdoors and other signs). To place a sign, use a sign item while pointing at the block the sign should be attached to, enter the desired text (or none), and click the \"Done\" button or press \"escape\" on a keyboard (or press \u00d7 in Bedrock Edition,  on an Xbox controller,  on a PlayStation controller, or  on a Nintendo Switch controller. Closing the virtual keyboard on a mobile device also exits the typing menu). To place a sign on a block that can be interacted with by the use control (for example, chests, note blocks, etc.), sneak while placing the sign. Signs on the top of a block stand on a short post and face toward the player who placed it, in any of 16 different directions. Signs placed on the side of a block simply float there, even if the block doesn't make contact with the sign. Even if placed on a vertical surface, a sign may not co-exist in the same block of air as any other item, despite not necessarily visibly obstructing eachother. For more information about the blocks signs can be placed on, see Opacity/Placement.\n\n  Text\n    Placing a sign opens an editor interface resembling a magnified view of the sign. Up to four lines of text can then be entered using a keyboard (hardware or on-screen). The editor supports limited editing, including moving the cursor and inserting and deleting characters. In Bedrock Edition, formatting codes can also be used to apply decorative effects such as color, bold, italic and underline to various bits of the text. Depending on the edition and platform in use, copy and paste operations may be supported and the editor may also support keyboard entry of Alt-codes for displaying Unicode characters. Text can be added to the back side of a sign by interacting with the that side of the sign after placing it and editing the front. Signs can be waxed by using a honeycomb on it. Once waxed, a sign cannot be unwaxed or edited. After placing and affixing text on a sign, a player can change the text color by using a dye on it. When colored with dye, the text color may differ from any color specified by formatting codes.[more information needed] A player can use a glow ink sac on a sign to make its text glow. The glowing text is not affected by lighting. The player can use a regular black ink sac on the sign to remove the glowing effect.\n\n    Name,Main Color,Edge Color\n\n    Black,#000000,#EDE8CA\n\n    Red,#FC0000,#650000\n\n    Green,#00FC00,#006500\n\n    Brown,#894413,#361B07\n\n    Blue,#0000FC,#000065\n\n    Purple,#9E20ED,#3F0C5F\n\n    Cyan,#00D6D6,#006565\n\n    Light Gray,#D0D0D0,#535353\n\n    Gray,#7E7E7E,#323232\n\n    Pink,#FC68B2,#652947\n\n    Lime,#8DFC00,#4B6500\n\n    Yellow,#FCFC00,#656500\n\n    Light Blue,#98BECB,#3C4B51\n\n    Magenta,#FC00FC,#650065\n\n    Orange,#FC671F,#65280C\n\n    White,#FCFCFC,#656565\n\n\n    In Creative mode, the combination Ctrl + pick block on Windows/Linux, or \u2318 Cmd + pick block on macOS, can be used to copy an already-placed sign, including its text (with decorations), into the player's inventory. A dyed sign facing east or west has text that appears more saturated and bright than a sign facing north or south. However, it is actually the sign that is dimmer, because Minecraft's lighting engine uses side lighting to make the world appear less flat, but the text on signs is not affected by this. In Bedrock Edition, inappropriate words or phrases in a sign's text are displayed as asterisks. In Java Edition, signs can be created with JSON text, which allows complex formatting (colors, bold, italic, etc.), hover and click events, localized translation (for Minecraft technical terms, like \"Redstone Repeater\", otherwise translations must be provided in language files in resource packs), and the incorporation of scoreboard values into text. Use the /data merge block command to create or alter JSON signs. Example: /data merge block ~ ~1 ~ {front_text:{ color:\"green\", messages:[ '{\"selector\":\"@p\", \"bold\":false, \"italic\":false, \"underlined\":false, \"strikethrough\":false, \"obfuscated\":false}' , '{\"text\":\"Second Line\"}']}} Signs can post the success count of JSON text hover and click events to scoreboard objectives. The objectives to be used can be specified by running the /execute store command or by modifying the sign's NBT data directly with the /data merge block command.\n\n  Interaction\n    Signs can be edited after being placed by using them, which opens the edit sign message GUI. Signs are destroyed and drop as an item when pushed by a piston.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Signs are non-solid and have no collision, so items and mobs can move through sign blocks. Other blocks (including other signs) can be placed on any edge of a sign. Water and lava flow around signs. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to signs as if the signs were flammable, but the signs do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either, except in Bedrock Edition).\n\n  Fuel\n    Wooden signs can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting an item per sign.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Signs can be placed under note blocks to produce a \"bass\" sounds.\n\n",

Unlike sand, there is no red sandstone that supports it below.\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders sell 4 red sand for one emerald.\u200c\n\n  Renewability\n    The only renewable method of obtaining red sand is through the wandering trader. Due to its low spawning rate and limited number of trades per spawn, it is more practical to obtain it through other means.\n\nUsage\n    If the supporting block below a block of red sand is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the red sand block turns into a \"falling block\" entity, which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity is available in the main article listed above. If falling red sand lands and covers the head of a mob or the player, the mob or player buried in it continuously receives suffocation damage. If falling red sand lands in the space occupied by a non-solid block (such as torch, rail, or redstone dust) or a block less than a full block tall (such as slab or soul sand[1]), the red sand drops and turns into an item. If it falls onto a cobweb, it falls slowly until it has gone through completely; if it touches the ground while still inside the cobweb, the red sand becomes an item. Red sand that falls onto a lifting bubble column floats on top of the water until the bubble column is blocked or removed.

The respawn anchor keeps its current level of charges with the Pick Block option in Creative mode, and it is unique in the fact that this does not work on blocks with different states like the redstone lamp or daylight sensor.[1]\n\n    Block,Respawn Anchor\n\n    Hardness,50\n\n    Tool,diamond pickaxe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,250\n\n    Wooden,125\n\n    Stone,62.5\n\n    Iron,41.7\n\n    Diamond,9.4\n\n    Netherite,8.35\n\n    Golden,20.85\n\n\n  Crafting\n    While the ingredients to craft a respawn anchor are all native to the Nether, they are also obtainable in the Overworld: glowstone can be obtained from trading with villagers or wandering trader, or crafted from glowstone dust dropped by witches; crying obsidian can be found in ruined portals and obtained with piglin bartering.\n\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Crying Obsidian + Glowstone,\"[['Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian'], ['Glowstone', 'Glowstone', 'Glowstone'], ['Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Respawning\n    The respawn anchor is used to respawn in the Nether, even if the player leaves the Nether. Once the block is charged, it can be used to set the player's respawn location. Charging When crafted, a respawn anchor has no (zero) charge and can't yet be used until charged. Using a glowstone block (not glowstone dust) on it adds a charge. The anchor accepts up to 4 charges, and the charge level is indicated by a dial on the side of the block. The first charge makes the respawn anchor glow with a light level of 3. Each glowstone after the first increases the light level by 4, up to a maximum of 15. Setting respawn To set the player's spawn location to the respawn anchor they must use it, just like one does with a bed. The anchor must at least have one charge, and it must be in the Nether. A confirmation appears when the player's respawn location is set. Other players can also set their spawn point to the same respawn anchor. Each respawn uses up one charge, even if used by another player. Using a charged anchor overrides any other spawn location the player might have had, as with a bed. The respawn anchor does not serve as a backup spawn point to a missing or obstructed bed. Respawn upon player death Upon death, the player respawns next to the anchor, and it loses one charge. If a player's respawn anchor is destroyed, if its charges have been exhausted, or if the area around it is made unsuitable for respawning, a message appears saying \"You have no home bed or charged Respawn Anchor, or it was obstructed\", and the player respawns at the world spawn point. Returning through an end portal is not counted as a respawn against the charges. A respawn anchor can be shared among several players. When shared, remaining charges are shared as well.\nIn Hardcore mode, the respawn anchor does not resurrect the player, but may still teleport them and consume charges.\n\n  Exploding\n    If the player attempts to set their spawn at a charged respawn anchor in the Overworld, the End, or custom dimensions in which they are disabled, the block explodes (and is destroyed) similar to when a bed is used in the Nether or the End. The explosion has a power of 5 and sets fire to surrounding blocks.\n\n  Redstone component\n    When charged, a redstone comparator gives a signal depending on the number of charges: 3 for one charge, 7 for two charges, 11 for three charges, 15 for four charges. An empty anchor gives a signal of 0. The respawn anchor can also be charged with a dispenser. The respawn anchor cannot be pushed by a piston.\n\n  Mobs\n    Hoglins run away from respawn anchors.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Respawn anchors can be placed under note blocks to produce the \"bass drum\" sound.\n\n",

If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect vibrations behind it. Similarly, if a wool block is placed between a sensor and a sculk shrieker, the sensor is unable to alert the shrieker. Sculk sensors are not able to detect the placing and breaking of wool, as well as entities walking, sprinting, or jumping on top of it. They are also unable to detect items dropped on wool, or wool itself dropped in item form. Similar to sculk sensors, wardens are also unable to detect everything wool-related as listed above.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Wool blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce guitar sounds.\u200c\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Any color of wool or wood can be used for paintings but it has no effect on the product's final appearance.\n\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Banner,Matching Wool + Stick,\"[['White Wool', 'White Wool', 'White Wool'], ['White Wool', 'White Wool', 'White Wool'], [None, 'Stick', None]]\",\"Once the banner is crafted, its base color cannot be changed.\u200c [ Java Edition only ]\"\n\n    Bed,Matching Wool + Any Planks,\"[[None, None, None], ['White Wool', 'White Wool', 'White Wool'], ['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks']]\",The wool color must match.

The power level output varies depending on the number of entities colliding with the pressure plate. The signal strength from a weighted pressure plate does not vary with the type of entity. 15 mobs will produce the same signal strength as 15 different items. Note the light weighted presser plate counts entities, not quantity of items, generally leading to one entity count per stack of items.

When active, it changes to a lighter block state without a change to the light level.\n\n  Vibration detection\n    Sculk sensors detect vibrations in an 8 block spherical radius around it. Vibrations are caused by various events, such as a player and mobs walking, placing or breaking blocks, gliding with elytra, items falling on the ground, a piston extending or a wet wolf shaking itself off. While sneaking, a player is not detected. Walking, falling, dropping items, or shooting a projectile all trigger the sensor. When a vibration is made within the range of a sculk sensor, a signal travels from the vibration source to the sensor at a speed of one block per game tick (20 blocks per second). When the signal arrives, the sensor is activated for 40 game ticks (2 seconds). The sensor cannot detect any other vibrations while activated or while a signal is traveling to it. Sculk sensors have a cooldown period of 1 game tick (0.05 seconds) after being placed or after deactivating. During this short cooldown period, they cannot detect vibrations. This prevents them from activating when a contraption it is powering is being unpowered. Sculk sensors don't detect vibrations from other sculk sources or the warden. Wool and carpets have a special interaction with sculk sensors. If a wool block is placed between a sensor and a vibration source, the sensor is not able to detect the placed wool nor vibrations behind it. Specifically, if the ray joining the cube centers of the sensor block and the vibration source passes through any wool blocks, the noise is muffled. If the ray passes diagonally through the edge between two blocks, either one or the other block may muffle it but not both. Sculk sensors are not able to detect footsteps or dropped items on wool blocks or carpet, and they are also unable to detect dropped items of wool and carpets. Sculk sensors pass on the vibrations made by players to sculk shriekers within 8 blocks of the sensor. For example, an item dropped by a player triggers the shrieker, but an item dropped by a dispenser or from a broken block does not; a player flying around with elytra triggers the shrieker, but a bat flying around does not. Alarms can be blocked by wool placed in between the sensor and shrieker, similar to how wool can block vibrations from reaching the sensor itself.\n\n  Redstone emission\n    Sculk sensors emit a redstone signal when they are activated. The strength of the redstone signal is inversely proportional to the distance the vibration signal traveled \u2013 the closer the vibration is to the sculk sensor, the stronger the redstone signal is, so it reaches the maximum redstone signal strength when the vibration is directly on top of the sensor. Each vibration in the game falls under a certain amplitude value. This value can be measured with a comparator. With the right contraption, the player could detect if a certain action has occurred or is occurring nearby.\n\n    Output,Vibration type,Game event,Description\n\n    1,Step,minecraft:step,Player or entity steps\n\n    Swim,minecraft:swim,\"Player or entity swims, boat paddles\"\n\n    Flap,minecraft:flap,Entity flaps (bat)\n\n    Resonate 1,minecraft:resonate_1,\n\n    2,Projectile Land,minecraft:projectile_land,Projectile lands (snowball)\n\n    Hit Ground,minecraft:hit_ground,Player or entity hits ground post-jump or fall\n\n    Splash,minecraft:splash,Player or entity splashes.

They can be found in every Nether biome, although they are significantly rarer in soul sand valleys,[1] because the ceiling of this biome is made of soul sand or soul soil below which glowstone blobs cannot generate; they can still occasionally generate in caves and canyons in this biome,[2] because the ceiling is made of netherrack.

They emit the same amount of light as lanterns, sea lanterns, jack o'lanterns, redstone lamps, conduits, beacons, shroomlights, and froglights.\n\n  Redstone circuits\n    When placing redstone dust on a glowstone block, being a transparent block, signals can pass from one block to another diagonally. Redstone wire, even though it may appear to connect up the side of a glowstone block and to the wire portion on top, does not send a redstone signal down the glowstone block. This makes glowstone effective for vertical diodes, logic gate designs, and space-efficient instant vertical redstone. Note that upside-down slabs can be used for the same purpose, and are easier to obtain.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Glowstone, like other pushable blocks, becomes a block of moving piston when moved by a piston; this momentarily stops it from giving off light.[3]\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Redstone Lamp,Redstone Dust + Glowstone,\"[[None, 'Redstone Dust', None], ['Redstone Dust', '', 'Redstone Dust'], [None, 'Redstone Dust', None]]\"\n\n    Respawn Anchor,Crying Obsidian + Glowstone,\"[['Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian'], ['', '', ''], ['Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian', 'Crying Obsidian']]\"\n\n\n  Note blocks\n    Glowstone can be placed under note blocks to produce pling sounds.\n\n  Respawn anchors\n    Glowstone is used to charge respawn anchors. If a dispenser containing glowstone is facing a respawn anchor, it can automatically charge the respawn anchor when powered.\n\n  Transparent block\n    Glowstone blocks all sunlight, players and mobs suffocate inside it, mobs are able to pathfind to it, and it blocks a beacon beam, preventing the beacon's activation. However, like transparent blocks, it does not prevent the opening of chests, monsters (including slimes) cannot spawn on it, and it does not transfer a redstone signal. This behavior also occurs in sea lanterns.\n\n",

A single candle emits a light level of 3. Up to four identically colored candles may be placed in one block, with each candle increasing the emitted light level by 3, for a maximum light level of 12. They also emit fire particles. Candles are not lit when they are placed, and must be lit using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile. If a candle is already lit, more candle(s) that may be added (if possible) are also lit. In Bedrock Edition, a mob/player that is burning, a Fire Aspect book or any sword enchanted with Fire Aspect can also be used to light candles. Candles may be waterlogged, but waterlogged candles cannot be lit. Lit candles can be extinguished using water (even a water bottle\u200c[Java Edition  only]) or by the player interacting with the candle.\n\n  Cakes\n    A single candle of any color may be used on an uneaten cake, turning it into a candle cake, which acts as a normal, singular candle on top of a cake. If the candle cake is eaten at all or destroyed, the candle is dropped. Interacting with the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it. Interacting with a lit candle cake causes the player to eat it if possible, but if the held item is a flint and steel or fire charge, the appropriate block becomes lit, if possible (otherwise nothing happens).\n\n",

In Bedrock Edition, the cauldrons generated there are 1\u20443 to 2\u20443 full of a random potion. A cauldron 2\u20443 full of water is generated in each igloo basement. Cauldrons can be found in a few rooms inside of woodland mansions. Two filled cauldrons can be found inside savanna, taiga, snowy taiga, and snowy tundra village tannery houses. A single filled cauldron can be found in plains village and desert village tannery houses. In Java Edition, three filled cauldrons can be found in plains village tannery houses. Cauldrons can also spawn in trail ruins.\n\n  Crafting\n    A cauldron can be crafted from iron ingots.\n\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Iron Ingot,\"[['Iron Ingot', None, 'Iron Ingot'], ['Iron Ingot', None, 'Iron Ingot'], ['Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Storage for substances\n    Cauldrons can hold a variety of substances. Fluids they cannot hold include milk, honey and any food items that exist in bowls; namely mushroom stew, beetroot soup, rabbit stew and suspicious stew. In Java Edition, cauldrons containing fluids are considered by the game to be separate blocks from each other and from empty cauldrons, which does not affect gameplay but does affect the commands needed to place them. A cauldron can be filled with water by using a water bucket on the cauldron. Once completely filled, a cauldron can be used to fill a water bucket by using an empty bucket on the cauldron; this empties the cauldron. Despite containing water, using a fish bucket on a cauldron does not fill it with water, but places water against it, meaning it does nothing to the cauldron.[1] A cauldron can also be filled by dumping a water bucket on the block above the cauldron. Once the water block is removed, the cauldron is filled to the full level with water.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] It can contain three levels of water. One level of water can be added to a cauldron by using a water bottle on it. One level of water can be removed from a cauldron, filling a water bottle, by using a glass bottle on it. A cauldron slowly fills with water when rained upon, if starting empty or with some water. This happens randomly, at 5% of the rate in which snow accumulates on the ground during snowfall. Water can be stored in a cauldron even in the Nether. Water in a cauldron does not freeze in cold biomes. Water in a cauldron does not absorb explosion damage; make sounds and particles; absorb fall damage;[2][3] allow Riptide tridents to activate;[4][5] or damage endermen, striders, or blazes.[6] Cauldrons do not deal drowning damage to mobs inside of them[7] and fish act as if there is no water inside it.[8] The player cannot float or swim in it, as the water is about level with the player's waist. Jumping in a cauldron does not produce any bubble or water particles. A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has water placed a block above it slowly fills with water. The same works with lava, allowing for infinite lava generation. Attempting to add lava or potion to water empties the cauldron.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] The water in a cauldron cannot be sucked up by a sponge, whether the sponge is touching the cauldron or not. In Bedrock Edition, leather armor is dyed through a cauldron, so a cauldron can hold dyed water. Using a dye on a cauldron filled with water colors the water, consuming the dye. Different dyes may be added to produce mixed colors. Using leather armor or leather horse armor on the cauldron dyes that item the color of the water, reducing the water in the cauldron by one level for each item dyed. Attempting to add water, lava or potion to dyed water empties the cauldron. Cauldrons can be used to hold lava. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when a cauldron is already filled with water, it empties the cauldron and makes an extinguishing sound. A cauldron filled with lava emits a light level of 15, similar to lava, and burns any entity inside of it; in Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, this includes mobs that do not take damage from lava like zombified piglins. Lava inside a cauldron does not interact with water outside of the cauldron. The lava disappears upon putting water in the cauldron. A redstone comparator with a lava cauldron behind it outputs redstone signal strength of 3.[9][10] A cauldron placed below a down-facing pointed dripstone that has lava placed a block above it slowly fills with lava. If a cauldron is filled by lava, using glass bottles on the cauldron does nothing. Powder snow is currently the only solid material that can be stored in a cauldron. A cauldron slowly fills with powder snow during snowfall, if starting empty or with any layer of powder snow already inside. Up to three layers can be filled. When the cauldron is full, interacting using a bucket, creates a powder snow bucket and empties the cauldron. Entities standing in the cauldron do not take freeze damage, and entities wearing leather boots still fall through the powder snow. A redstone comparator with a powder snow cauldron behind it outputs a redstone signal strength proportional to the fill level, up to 3. Contrary to a cauldron filled with water, a powder snow cauldron that is not full cannot be filled up with a powder snow bucket, as using the bucket on the cauldron instead places powder snow against it. In Bedrock Edition, a cauldron can hold normal potions, splash potions and lingering potions. Using a potion on a cauldron empties the potion and increases the level of the potion in the cauldron by one level. A glass bottle can then be used on a cauldron with a potion in it, filling the bottle with that potion. This reduces the potion in the cauldron by one level. Using an arrow on a cauldron that contains a potion transforms the arrow into a tipped arrow with that potion effect, and reduce the potion in the cauldron by one level. Tipping multiple arrows at once can be more efficient, and it may use more than one level at once. 1 level of potion tips up to 16 arrows, 2 levels up to 32, and a full cauldron can tip a full stack of arrows, resulting in 21.33 tipped arrows per potion. Attempting to put water, lava or a different potion into a cauldron with a potion causes an explosion sound, and the cauldron is emptied. An entity that stands in a cauldron filled to any level with any potion does not receive the effect of the potion. Using an empty bucket on a cauldron filled with any potion does nothing, as the bucket remains empty and the potion in the cauldron does not empty.\n\n  Removing dye from items\n    A cauldron with water can wash the dye off of leather armor and shulker boxes, and can remove the top-most pattern layer of a banner, by pressing use on the cauldron with the leather armor, shulker box, or banner in hand. Each wash reduces the water in the cauldron by one level. The water does not become dyed while removing dye from objects.\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village has a cauldron that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager that does not already have a profession or job site block may change their profession to leatherworker.\n\n  Extinguishing fire\n    A cauldron with water or powder snow extinguishes entities on fire that fall into it and the entity emits black particles. This includes mobs, players, items (if they land in the cauldron before burning up), and flaming arrows\u200c[JE  only]. Flaming arrows stuck into the side are also extinguished. Entities must reach the water or powder snow in it. Each entity extinguished causes the substance in the cauldron to decrease by one level. If the cauldron is filled with powder snow, it then becomes a water cauldron.\n\n  Redstone component\n    A cauldron can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a cauldron behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength proportional to how full the cauldron is: 0 for empty, 1 for one-third full, 2 for two-thirds full, and 3 for completely full or filled with lava. However, if there is a block between the cauldron and the comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A note block is a block that emits sounds when attacked, used or powered with redstone. The sound produced can be altered in various ways by using it or putting certain blocks directly above or below it. A note block's sound played repeatedly can be used to direct allays to stay nearby and drop collected items near it.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Note blocks are most quickly broken with an axe.\n\n    Block,Note Block\n\n    Hardness,0.8\n\n    Tool,Axe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,1.2\n\n    Wooden,0.6\n\n    Stone,0.3\n\n    Iron,0.2\n\n    Diamond,0.15\n\n    Netherite,0.15\n\n    Golden,0.1\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Note blocks generate in ancient cities.\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Any Planks + Redstone Dust,\"[['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks'], ['Oak Planks', 'Redstone Dust', 'Oak Planks'], ['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Playing music\n    Note blocks play a musical note when hit (pressing the attack button) or powered by redstone. A note block must have air in the space directly above it to play a sound. Notes can be heard up to 48 blocks away. The volume of a note block decreases as the player gets further away from it. The sound of note blocks (as well as jukeboxes) can be independently controlled by the Jukebox/Note Blocks slider in the audio settings. Note blocks play when on or next to a powered block. Each time a note block plays a note, a note particle may fly out of the top (if pressed too fast, notes may not appear), with the color depending on the pitch (but not the instrument). There are 16 different instruments and 25 different pitches per instrument. Pressing the use button on the block increases the note pitch up a semitone, with a total of two full octaves and a semitone (25 semitones in total) being available for each instrument. The standard range (for harp and pling instruments) of notes span from F\u266f3 to F\u266f5. After reaching the highest note, pressing use again resets the pitch back to F\u266f3, as does breaking the block and picking it back up. The string bass and didgeridoo are two octaves (24 semitones) lower than the standard range, the guitar is one octave (12 semitones) lower than the standard range, the flute is one octave above the standard range, and the bells, chimes, and xylophone are 2 octaves above the standard range. This gives the player six octaves (72 semitones) of effective range to combine instruments for greater pitch coverage. The exact pitch can be found from its use-count by using the following formula: 2 ^ ((use count - 12) / 12). The exact pitch to use-count assignment is shown below,[1][2] along with the note's color, which is rendered with shading using the particle's texture.\n\n    Pitch (Octave 1) Use Count Pitch ( / playsound ) Color ( hex ) F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se 0 0.5 #77D700 G - Sol 1 2^(-11/12) \u2248 0.529732 #95C000 G\u266f/A\u266d- Si/Le 2 2^(-10/12) \u2248 0.561231 #B2A500 A - La 3 2^(-9/12) \u2248 0.594604 #CC8600 A\u266f/B\u266d- Li/Te 4 2^(-8/12) \u2248 0.629961 #E26500 B - Ti 5 2^(-7/12) \u2248\u00a00.667420 #F34100 C - Do 6 2^(-6/12) \u2248 0.707107 #FC1E00 C\u266f/D\u266d- Di/Ra 7 2^(-5/12) \u2248 0.749154 #FE000F D - Re 8 2^(-4/12) \u2248 0.793701 #F70033 D\u266f/E\u266d- Ri/Me 9 2^(-3/12) \u2248 0.840896 #E8005A E - Mi 10 2^(-2/12) \u2248\u00a00.890899 #CF0083 F - Fa 11 2^(-1/12) \u2248 0.943874 #AE00A9 F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se 12 1.0 #8600CC,Pitch (Octave 1),Use Count,Pitch ( / playsound ),Color ( hex ),F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,0,0.5,#77D700,G - Sol,1,2^(-11/12) \u2248 0.529732,#95C000,G\u266f/A\u266d- Si/Le,2,2^(-10/12) \u2248 0.561231,#B2A500,A - La,3,2^(-9/12) \u2248 0.594604,#CC8600,A\u266f/B\u266d- Li/Te,4,2^(-8/12) \u2248 0.629961,#E26500,B - Ti,5,2^(-7/12) \u2248\u00a00.667420,#F34100,C - Do,6,2^(-6/12) \u2248 0.707107,#FC1E00,C\u266f/D\u266d- Di/Ra,7,2^(-5/12) \u2248 0.749154,#FE000F,D - Re,8,2^(-4/12) \u2248 0.793701,#F70033,D\u266f/E\u266d- Ri/Me,9,2^(-3/12) \u2248 0.840896,#E8005A,E - Mi,10,2^(-2/12) \u2248\u00a00.890899,#CF0083,F - Fa,11,2^(-1/12) \u2248 0.943874,#AE00A9,F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,12,1.0,#8600CC,Pitch (Octave 2) Use Count Pitch ( / playsound ) Color ( hex ) F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se 12 1.0 #8600CC G - Sol 13 2^(1/12) \u2248 1.059463 #5B00E7 G\u266f/A\u266d- Si/Le 14 2^(2/12) \u2248 1.122462 #2D00F9 A - La 15 2^(3/12) \u2248 1.189207 #020AFE A\u266f/B\u266d- Li/Te 16 2^(4/12) \u2248\u00a01.259921 #0037F6 B - Ti 17 2^(5/12) \u2248 1.334840 #0068E0 C - Do 18 2^(6/12) \u2248\u00a01.414214 #009ABC C\u266f/D\u266d- Di/Ra 19 2^(7/12) \u2248 1.498307 #00C68D D - Re 20 2^(8/12) \u2248\u00a01.587401 #00E958 D\u266f/E\u266d- Ri/Me 21 2^(9/12) \u2248\u00a01.681793 #00FC21 E - Mi 22 2^(10/12) \u2248 1.781797 #1FFC00 F - Fa 23 2^(11/12) \u2248 1.887749 #59E800 F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se 24 2.0 #94C100,Pitch (Octave 2),Use Count,Pitch ( / playsound ),Color ( hex ),F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,12,1.0,#8600CC,G - Sol,13,2^(1/12) \u2248 1.059463,#5B00E7,G\u266f/A\u266d- Si/Le,14,2^(2/12) \u2248 1.122462,#2D00F9,A - La,15,2^(3/12) \u2248 1.189207,#020AFE,A\u266f/B\u266d- Li/Te,16,2^(4/12) \u2248\u00a01.259921,#0037F6,B - Ti,17,2^(5/12) \u2248 1.334840,#0068E0,C - Do,18,2^(6/12) \u2248\u00a01.414214,#009ABC,C\u266f/D\u266d- Di/Ra,19,2^(7/12) \u2248 1.498307,#00C68D,D - Re,20,2^(8/12) \u2248\u00a01.587401,#00E958,D\u266f/E\u266d- Ri/Me,21,2^(9/12) \u2248\u00a01.681793,#00FC21,E - Mi,22,2^(10/12) \u2248 1.781797,#1FFC00,F - Fa,23,2^(11/12) \u2248 1.887749,#59E800,F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,24,2.0,#94C100\n\n    Pitch (Octave 1),Use Count,Pitch ( / playsound ),Color ( hex )\n\n    F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,0,0.5,#77D700\n\n    G - Sol,1,2^(-11/12) \u2248 0.529732,#95C000\n\n    G\u266f/A\u266d- Si/Le,2,2^(-10/12) \u2248 0.561231,#B2A500\n\n    A - La,3,2^(-9/12) \u2248 0.594604,#CC8600\n\n    A\u266f/B\u266d- Li/Te,4,2^(-8/12) \u2248 0.629961,#E26500\n\n    B - Ti,5,2^(-7/12) \u2248\u00a00.667420,#F34100\n\n    C - Do,6,2^(-6/12) \u2248 0.707107,#FC1E00\n\n    C\u266f/D\u266d- Di/Ra,7,2^(-5/12) \u2248 0.749154,#FE000F\n\n    D - Re,8,2^(-4/12) \u2248 0.793701,#F70033\n\n    D\u266f/E\u266d- Ri/Me,9,2^(-3/12) \u2248 0.840896,#E8005A\n\n    E - Mi,10,2^(-2/12) \u2248\u00a00.890899,#CF0083\n\n    F - Fa,11,2^(-1/12) \u2248 0.943874,#AE00A9\n\n    F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,12,1.0,#8600CC\n\n    Pitch (Octave 2),Use Count,Pitch ( / playsound ),Color ( hex )\n\n    F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,12,1.0,#8600CC\n\n    G - Sol,13,2^(1/12) \u2248 1.059463,#5B00E7\n\n    G\u266f/A\u266d- Si/Le,14,2^(2/12) \u2248 1.122462,#2D00F9\n\n    A - La,15,2^(3/12) \u2248 1.189207,#020AFE\n\n    A\u266f/B\u266d- Li/Te,16,2^(4/12) \u2248\u00a01.259921,#0037F6\n\n    B - Ti,17,2^(5/12) \u2248 1.334840,#0068E0\n\n    C - Do,18,2^(6/12) \u2248\u00a01.414214,#009ABC\n\n    C\u266f/D\u266d- Di/Ra,19,2^(7/12) \u2248 1.498307,#00C68D\n\n    D - Re,20,2^(8/12) \u2248\u00a01.587401,#00E958\n\n    D\u266f/E\u266d- Ri/Me,21,2^(9/12) \u2248\u00a01.681793,#00FC21\n\n    E - Mi,22,2^(10/12) \u2248 1.781797,#1FFC00\n\n    F - Fa,23,2^(11/12) \u2248 1.887749,#59E800\n\n    F\u266f/G\u266d- Fi/Se,24,2.0,#94C100\n\n\n    Alternatively, there is a graphical version available:  Players can roughly check the tuning of a block by looking at the note icon.  In Java Edition, the tuning can also be checked by looking at the right side of the debug screen (accessed by pressing F3). It is denoted as \"note:\" followed by a number from 0 to 24. The instrument played depends on the material of the block underneath the note block. Note that these are groups of blocks defined by the code, not just the individual block. When a mob head is placed on top of a note block, the sound made by the note block will instead be that of the corresponding mob's ambient sound, with the exception of the creeper head, which instead causes the note block to play the primed sound.\n\n    Block,Instrument,Range,Sound event names (Java),Sound event names (Bedrock)\n\n    Material: Wood,Bass (String Bass),F\u266f 1 \u2013F\u266f 3,block.note_block.bass,note.bass\n\n    \"Material: Sand, Gravel, Concrete Powder\",Snare Drum,\u2014,block.note_block.snare,note.snare\n\n    \"Material: Glass, Sea Lantern, Beacon\",Clicks and Sticks (Hihat),\u2014,block.note_block.hat,note.hat\n\n    \"Material: Stone, Blackstone, Netherrack, Nylium, Obsidian, Quartz, Sandstone, Ores, Bricks, Corals, Respawn Anchor, Bedrock, Concrete , Observer\",Bass Drum (Kick),\u2014,block.note_block.basedrum,note.bd\n\n    Block of Gold,Bells (Glockenspiel),F\u266f 5 \u2013F\u266f 7,block.note_block.bell,note.bell\n\n    \"Clay , Honeycomb Block \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ] [3] , Infested Block \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ]\",Flute,F\u266f 4 \u2013F\u266f 6,block.note_block.flute,note.flute\n\n    Packed Ice,Chimes,F\u266f 5 \u2013F\u266f 7,block.note_block.chime,note.chime\n\n    Wool,Guitar,F\u266f 2 \u2013F\u266f 4,block.note_block.guitar,note.guitar\n\n    Bone Block,Xylophone,F\u266f 5 \u2013F\u266f 7,block.note_block.xylophone,note.xylophone\n\n    Block of Iron,Iron Xylophone (Vibraphone),F\u266f 3 \u2013F\u266f 5,block.note_block.iron_xylophone,note.iron_xylophone\n\n    Soul Sand,Cow Bell,F\u266f 4 \u2013F\u266f 6,block.note_block.cow_bell,note.cow_bell\n\n    Pumpkin,Didgeridoo,F\u266f 1 \u2013F\u266f 3,block.note_block.didgeridoo,note.didgeridoo\n\n    Block of Emerald,\"\"\"Bit\"\" (Square wave)\",F\u266f 3 \u2013F\u266f 5,block.note_block.bit,note.bit\n\n    Hay Bale,Banjo,F\u266f 3 \u2013F\u266f 5,block.note_block.banjo,note.banjo\n\n    Glowstone,\"\"\"Pling\"\" (Electric piano)\",F\u266f 3 \u2013F\u266f 5,block.note_block.pling,note.pling\n\n    Skeleton Skull,\"\"\"Skeleton\"\"\",-,block.note_block.imitate.skeleton,note.skeleton\n\n    Wither Skeleton Skull,\"\"\"Wither Skeleton\"\"\",-,block.note_block.imitate.wither_skeleton,note.witherskeleton\n\n    Player Head,Sound event set in note_block_sound,-,Dependent,Dependent\n\n    Zombie Head,\"\"\"Zombie\"\"\",-,block.note_block.imitate.zombie,note.zombie\n\n    Creeper Head,\"\"\"Creeper\"\"\",-,block.note_block.imitate.creeper,note.creeper\n\n    Piglin Head,\"\"\"Piglin\"\"\",-,block.note_block.imitate.piglin,note.piglin\n\n    Dragon Head,\"\"\"Ender Dragon\"\"\",-,block.note_block.imitate.ender_dragon,note.enderdragon\n\n    Any other blocks,Harp / piano,F\u266f 3 \u2013F\u266f 5,block.note_block.harp,note.harp\n\n\n    Note blocks can be powered in a variety of different ways following normal redstone principles; however, some ways of powering note blocks are more convenient than others or produce unexpected results. If an allay hears a note block play within 16 blocks of its location, it tries to path find to the note block and then spends 30 seconds around that particular note block, seeking items around it and returning them to it instead of its player. After 30 seconds, the allay returns to targeting its player. A vibration particle emanates from the note block and reaches the allay to indicate the allay has locked on to the note block. Because the allay and the note block interact via a vibration particle, placing wool between the note block and the allay can prevent this interaction.\n\n  Fuel\n    Note blocks can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\n",

They can be brushed to extract structure-dependent loot, and are the only source of pottery sherds. Suspicious blocks drop nothing if they are broken, and break if they fall from any height or are moved with a piston.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Suspicious blocks are unobtainable by mining, even using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. They are much softer than normal sand and gravel, and can be instantly broken with merely an unenchanted diamond shovel. They are affected by gravity, but they always break with no drop after falling. They break immediately if pushed by a piston or sticky piston, and cannot be pulled by sticky pistons or slime blocks. In Java Edition, a suspicious block drops as an item if it falls for more than 30 seconds, which can be achieved by falling into an upward bubble column, or through two cobwebs stacked on top of each other.[1] However, it does not retain its loot. In Creative mode, the player can obtain a suspicious block while retaining its loot by using Ctrl + pick block on the block.\n\n    Block,Suspicious Sand Suspicious Gravel\n\n    Hardness,0.25\n\n    Tool,Shovel\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.4\n\n    Wooden,0.2\n\n    Stone,0.1\n\n    Iron,0.1\n\n    Diamond,0.05\n\n    Netherite,0.05\n\n    Golden,0.05\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Suspicious sand generates naturally in buried rooms under desert pyramids, as well as in the bottom of desert wells. It also generates within warm ocean ruins. Suspicious gravel generates naturally in cold ocean ruins. Additionally, some of the gravel within trail ruins is replaced with suspicious gravel upon generation.\n\nUsage\n  Brushing\n    When a brush is used on a suspicious block, cracks start to appear on all sides of the block as the dusted block state of the block starts to increase. If the suspicious block being brushed is naturally generated, an item gradually emerges from the side where the player starts brushing. After 96 game ticks (4.8 seconds), the item is extracted, and the suspicious block is converted into its regular counterpart: suspicious sand is converted into sand, and suspicious gravel is converted into gravel. If the player stops brushing a suspicious block, the block remains in its half-excavated state for a few seconds, before gradually returning to its unexcavated state one stage at a time.\n\n  Loot\n    The item obtained and the loot table of the block is dependent on which structure the suspicious block has generated in. Items can be extracted only from naturally generated suspicious blocks. When placed by the player, nothing is produced after brushing.\n\n",

Horizontal chains two blocks above a surface prevent players from traveling past them. Vertical chains block travel if targeted directly, but may be skirted.

There is no GUI; books are instead added into the bookshelf by using on a slot with a book. Doing so places a book in that slot. Using on an occupied slot removes the book from that slot. Chiseled bookshelves do not increase the power of enchanting tables.\n\n  Redstone signal\n    A redstone comparator sends a signal (1\u20136) indicating the last slot interacted with. When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0. An observer can detect when a book is added or removed from the bookshelf.\n\n  Hoppers, minecarts with hopper, and droppers\n    Hoppers and minecart with hoppers can insert and remove books from the bookshelf. As with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot. Droppers behave similarly when inserting books into the bookshelf. When a hopper that is not already 100% full fails to remove a book from a non-empty bookshelf because there is no room for the book in the hopper's inventory, that is still counted as an \"interaction\" with the slot. Thus, a hopper that cannot remove any of the books effectively sets the last-interacted slot to the last non-empty slot in the bookshelf.[2]\n\n  Fuel\n    Chiseled bookshelves can be used as fuel in furnaces to smelt 1.5 items.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Chiseled bookshelves can be placed under note blocks to produce a \"bass\" sound.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A slime block is a storage block equivalent to nine slimeballs. It has both sticky and bouncy properties making it useful in conjunction with pistons to move both blocks and entities.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Slime blocks can be broken instantly, regardless of held items, or when under the Mining Fatigue effect.\n\n    Block,Slime Block\n\n    Hardness,0\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.05\n\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Slimeball,\"[['Slimeball', 'Slimeball', 'Slimeball'], ['Slimeball', 'Slimeball', 'Slimeball'], ['Slimeball', 'Slimeball', 'Slimeball']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n    Landing on a slime block does not cause fall damage unless the player is sneaking. Slime blocks are also slightly slippery, but less so than ice. Slime blocks cause movement on top of them to slow down.\n\n  Bouncing\n    A player or mob that falls onto the top of a slime block bounces to a height proportional to the falling velocity. The bounce height quickly deteriorates. For example, a fall of 255 blocks produces a bounce height of about 50 blocks, while a fall of 50 blocks results in a bounce height of 22 blocks. The maximum bounce height is 57.625 blocks. Entities hitting the side of a slime block do not bounce, unless the slime block is moving using a piston. A player holding the jump key performs a normal jump on contact with the slime block without taking fall damage. A player holding sneak does not bounce at all and takes fall damage. Placing carpets, rails, trapdoors, redstone repeaters or redstone comparators on a slime block does not stop mobs from bouncing and not taking fall damage. Likewise, placing a pressure plate on a slime block does not stop mobs from bouncing, but the pressure plate still activates. Half-blocks such as Cakes and slabs stop the bouncing effect. Most mobs bounce off slime blocks. Exceptions are chickens, ghasts, bats, phantoms, bees, parrots, and vexes. Occasionally a horse may get stuck on a block when a player tries to spawn it on top of a slime block in Creative mode. Items, falling blocks, minecarts and boats do not bounce on slime blocks. Particles, however, do bounce. Players can also get around the fact that falling blocks, minecarts, and boats don't bounce by having sticky pistons with slime blocks bounce them.\n\n  Pistons\n    When being pushed by a piston, entities (except ender dragons, item frames and paintings) that are ahead are launched into the direction the block is pushed into. When pulled by a piston, no entities are launched. When a slime block is pushed or pulled by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent blocks in the same direction. The types of blocks that can be moved are the same as those that can be pulled by a sticky piston. Blocks that cannot be pulled by a sticky piston (i.e. all the blocks listed on the table on the pistons page) stay in place. The blocks that are moved may in turn push other blocks. For example, a slime block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which pushes additional ground blocks in the direction of motion just as if it were being pushed directly by a piston. Blocks such as glazed terracotta and honey blocks are exceptions; they do not move when adjacent slime blocks are moved, even if they are normally pushable by a piston. When the adjacent block that is moved is also a slime block, that block attempts to move all its adjacent blocks. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube and attempts to move all blocks adjacent to the cube. A slime block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. However, if an adjacent block could be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the slime block is also prevented from moving. This includes slime blocks being pulled rather than pushed, in which case the piston retracts without pulling anything. Liquids are an exception: they aren't moved, but neither do they stop a piston from pushing or pulling blocks into their space (usually destroying the liquid, and in a rare case displacing it through the piston). Slime blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-slime) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d73 of slime blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it. A piston cannot move itself via a \"loop\" constructed of slime blocks, but self-propelled contraptions can be created with multiple pistons.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Slimeball,Slime Block,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n",

Each chunk has 1\u204418 chance to generate a vegetation of kelp.\n\n  Trading\n    Kelp can be bought from wandering traders for 3 emeralds.\n\nUsage\n    Kelp can be placed underwater by hand, or anywhere by the use of commands such as /setblock. Placing it by hand gives it a random age value between 0 and 24. Kelp can be placed only in water source blocks or downward-flowing water, not horizontally flowing water. When placed in downward-flowing water, the kelp becomes waterlogged, transforming the flowing water into a water source block,[1] which is useful for faster bubble column elevator creation. Any building block can be placed on top of a kelp plant, which is useful for building structures over a deep ocean without needing to build from the ocean floor (see also lily pad).\n\n  Cooking ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Smelting recipe\n\n    Dried Kelp,Kelp + Any fuel,0.1\n\n\n  Composting\n    Placing kelp into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Growth mechanics\n    Kelp can be planted on a broad variety of blocks. It grows underwater if it has either a source block of water or, in Java Edition, flowing water above it.[2] Neither players nor dispensers can remove the water source block that kelp grows in without breaking the kelp first. Kelp does not require any light level to grow. Kelp also grows without having sky access. Bone meal can be used to grow kelp by 1 block on each use. Kelp, when planted, is generated with a randomly chosen age value, which can be checked when pressing F3\u200c[Java Edition  only]. The age value of a newly planted kelp plant varies randomly from 0 to 24. Each time the kelp grows in height by one block, the newly generated top of the kelp plant increases its age by 1. When the top block of the kelp plant reaches an age of 25, it stops growing. This means that kelp can naturally grow to a height between 2 (if the first kelp plant had an age of 24) and 26 blocks (if the first kelp plant had an age of 0). When a kelp plant block is broken, the age of the kelp plant block underneath is randomized to a value from 0 to 24 and the kelp continues growing until it reaches age 25. It is possible to use this mechanic to cultivate a kelp plant to increase its growth height beyond its natural maximum height of 26 blocks. This can be done by breaking the top-most block of the kelp plant each time it reaches age 25. A kelp plant cultivated by a player in this way repeatedly grows until it reaches the water surface. Each time it receives a random tick, kelp has a 14% chance of growing. If shears are used on the topmost block of kelp, that block automatically sets its age value to 25 and stops growing.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Farming\n    Kelp farming is similar to farming sugar cane, although kelp must be placed underwater. Automation of harvest is easier because items float up in water.\n\n",

They are broken instantly using any tool. They have a 33% chance to drop a single twisting vine when broken, increased to 55% with Fortune I, 77% with Fortune II, and 100% with Fortune III (or higher). They always drop a single twisting vine when broken with shears or with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch.  Any segments left unsupported from below break with a 33% drop chance, regardless of tool used. Accordingly, twisting vines are best harvested from the top.\n\n    Block,Twisting Vines [note 1]\n\n    Hardness,0\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.05\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Twisting vines generate naturally in the warped forest biome, either on the ground, or on warped huge fungus structures, and can be found only in the Nether.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Applying bone meal on warped nylium occasionally creates 1-block tall twisting vines on any nylium or netherrack nearby. Just like weeping vines, twisting vines have a 10% chance of growing one block each random tick. Unlike weeping vines, however, twisting vines grow upward. At default random tick speed, each fungus grows approximately every 13653 game ticks (11.3775 minutes). Twisting vines stop growing once they reach the ceiling or when the block reaches an age block state of 25, whichever is first.\n\nUsage\n    Twisting vines can be placed on any block except for transparent blocks (e.g. leaves and fences), and automatically begin to grow. Twisting vines can also be used similarly to a water bucket, as it can prevent fall damage. Applying bone meal to any block of twisting vines causes it to grow immediately. It occasionally spawns if bonemeal is used on warped nylium found in warped forest floors. Twisting vines stop growing if shears are used on the tip.\u200c\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Climbing\n    Twisting vines can be climbed by standing inside and holding the jump key. If there is a solid block behind the twisting vines, the walk forward key can also be used.\n\n  Compost\n    Twisting vines also have a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1 if placed in a composter.\n\n",

Pressing use on the jukebox again ejects the disc and stops any music playing. Music discs play only once before they must be ejected and reinserted. Note particles emit out the top when sound is playing. The sound from the jukebox travels roughly 65 blocks in all directions. It supports all available music discs in the game. Hoppers and droppers can be used to insert a disc into a jukebox. Tamed parrots and allays dance when in a 3 block radius from a jukebox that's playing a disc. If an amethyst shard is used on an allay dancing next to a playing jukebox, the allay consumes the amethyst shard, emits heart particles, and duplicates into two allays. Both allays have a 5-minute cooldown before they can be duplicated again.\n\n  Redstone component\n    Active jukeboxes give off a redstone signal when a redstone comparator is placed directly behind it or through an adjoining block; its strength depends on the ID of the inserted disc. The following table shows the redstone strength output for each disc.\n\n    Power Level,Disc\n\n    0,No disc inserted\n\n    1,\"\"\"13\"\"\"\n\n    2,\"\"\"cat\"\"\"\n\n    3,\"\"\"blocks\"\"\"\n\n    4,\"\"\"chirp\"\"\"\n\n    5,\"\"\"far\"\"\"\n\n    6,\"\"\"mall\"\"\"\n\n    7,\"\"\"mellohi\"\"\"\n\n    8,\"\"\"stal\"\"\"\n\n    9,\"\"\"strad\"\"\"\n\n    10,\"\"\"ward\"\"\"\n\n    11,\"\"\"11\"\"\"\n\n    12,\"\"\"wait\"\"\"\n\n    13,\"\"\"Pigstep\"\"\"\n\n    14,\"\"\"otherside\"\" \"\"Relic\"\"\"\n\n    15,\"\"\"5\"\"\"\n\n\n    They also emit a redstone signal when any music disc is played inside. Jukeboxes disable adjacent hoppers when a music disc is playing inside them, due to them emitting a redstone signal even without using a comparator. When the song ends, the hopper placed below the jukebox is re-enabled, so the disc is automatically ejected and stored in the hopper. A system of hoppers and droppers can then be used to automatically re-insert the disc, causing it to loop. If the hopper under the jukebox is powered by anything else, it does not eject the disc, breaking the loop.\n\n  Fuel\n    Jukeboxes can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Jukeboxes can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Jukeboxes cannot be pushed by pistons.

Endermen seen through iron bars do not become angry. The ender dragon cannot destroy iron bars (some of the end crystals are protected by them), which makes them a useful material in the End.\n\n  Placement\n    Iron bars can be placed in much the same way as fences or glass panes.

If something is placed next to iron bars, they appear either flat,  shaped,  shaped or  shaped, depending on the blocks surrounding it.\n\n  Curing\n    Iron bars speed up the curing process of zombie villagers.\n\n",

A flowering azalea also breaks if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location, or if water flows into it.\n\n    Block,Flowering Azalea\n\n    Hardness,0\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.05\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Flowering Azaleas generate commonly on top of moss in lush caves.\n\n  Post-generation\n    When decayed or mined with any tool except shears and tools enchanted with Silk Touch, flowering azalea leaves have a 5% chance to drop flowering azaleas. The Fortune enchantment increases the rate to 6.25% at level I, 8.33% at level II and 10% at level III. When using bone meal on a moss block, each block in a 3\u00d73 to 7\u00d77 area has a 5% chance of growing a flowering azalea.\n\nUsage\n    Flowering azaleas function like any other flowers in their interaction and uses with bees. Flowering azaleas can be placed on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, podzol, moss blocks, farmland, mud, muddy mangrove roots and clay. Unlike most transparent blocks, mobs can spawn on top of flowering azaleas in Java Edition[1].\n\n  Composting\n    Putting a flowering azalea in a composter has a 85% chance of increasing the composting level.\n\n  Fuel\n    Flowering azaleas can be used as a fuel source in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per azalea.\n\n  Growing trees\n    Unlike saplings, a flowering azalea does not automatically grow into an azalea tree. Therefore, using bone meal on it is the only way to grow an azalea tree. Application of bone meal gives a flowering azalea a 45% chance to grow into an azalea tree, provided there is a 3\u00d75\u00d73 area above it that is clear of all blocks that are not leaves or logs.\n\n  Bee nests\n    Oak and birch trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flowering azalea have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest containing 1 to 3 bees.\n\n",

However, if the lava flows on top of the water from above, stone is created instead. Non-flowing lava (a lava source block) turns into obsidian upon contact with water, thus the requirement of flowing lava.\n\nUsage\n    Cobblestone can be used as basic building block, as it has relatively high blast resistance and is extremely common.\n\n  Silverfish\n    Silverfish can enter and hide in cobblestone, creating an infested block.\n\n  Smelting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Smelting recipe\n\n    Stone,Cobblestone + Any fuel,0.1\n\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Andesite,Diorite + Cobblestone,\"[[None, None, None], ['Diorite', '', None], [None, None, None]]\",\n\n    Brewing Stand,Blaze Rod + Cobblestone,\"[[None, 'Blaze Rod', None], ['', '', ''], [None, None, None]]\",Can use cobblestone and its other variants interchangeably.\n\n    Coast Armor Trim Smithing Template,Diamond + Coast Armor Trim + Cobblestone,\"[['Diamond', 'Smithing Template', 'Diamond'], ['Diamond', '', 'Diamond'], ['Diamond', 'Diamond', 'Diamond']]\",\n\n    Cobblestone Slab,Cobblestone,\"[[None, None, None], [None, None, None], ['', '', '']]\",\n\n    Cobblestone Stairs,Cobblestone,\"[['', None, None], ['', '', None], ['', '', '']]\",\n\n    Cobblestone Wall,Cobblestone,\"[[None, None, None], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]\",\n\n    Diorite,Cobblestone + Nether Quartz,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Nether Quartz', None], ['Nether Quartz', '', None]]\",\n\n    Dispenser,Cobblestone + Bow + Redstone Dust,\"[['', '', ''], ['', 'Bow', ''], ['', 'Redstone Dust', '']]\",The bow can be of any durability .

This also allows for increased speed of items in water currents by placing the packed ice under the water current. Mobs do not travel faster in water currents on packed ice. In Java Edition, when a non-full block of half-block or less in height is placed on top of packed ice, the block inherits the same 'slipperiness' as the ice below it for most entities, not including boats due to a bug.[1] Additionally, any non-full block inherits the 'slipperiness' for items. Boats can travel on packed ice with a top speed of 40 m/s. Ice tracks built from blue ice, packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three dimensions. Mobs can spawn on packed ice. This can allow for compact mob farms that rely on the tendency of pushed mobs to slide off the ice in some way. Packed ice is a completely solid block, and allows placement of any objects on top. Unlike normal ice, packed ice does not melt if placed near light sources.

In Java Edition, they are also technically capable of growing in dripstone caves and deep dark biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. Natural azure bluets are found in plains villages. Potted azure bluets can also be generated in woodland mansions.\n\n  Post-generation\n    When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15\u00d75\u00d715 area. When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, azure bluets have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7\u00d75\u00d77 area. When bone meal is applied to an azure bluet that has been placed on top of a grass block, more azure bluets appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7\u00d77 square.\n\n  Mob loot\n    Endermen can pick up azure bluets, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders may sell an azure bluet for a single emerald.\n\nUsage\n    Like other flowers, azure bluets can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots. Azure bluets can also be placed in flower pots.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Light Gray Dye,Azure Bluet,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Suspicious stew\n    Using an azure bluet to make suspicious stew, whether by direct crafting or by feeding a brown mooshroom and then milking it with a bowl, imbues it with a Blindness effect that lasts 8 seconds in Java Edition and 6 seconds in Bedrock Edition.\n\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Red Mushroom + Brown Mushroom + Bowl + Azure Bluet,\"[[None, None, None], ['Red Mushroom', 'Brown Mushroom', None], ['Bowl', '', None]]\"\n\n\n  Bees\n    Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with azure bluets, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.\n\n  Breeding\n    Azure bluets can be used to breed, grow, and lead bees.\n\n  Bee nests\n    Oak, birch, and cherry trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of an azure bluet have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing an azure bluet into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

It also breaks when pushed with a piston or sticky piston. Breaking it at any spot on the plant causes the entire plant to collapse.

Using bone meal on a big dripleaf plant makes it one block taller, creating an extra stem block (see #Growth).\n\nUsage\n    Big dripleaves consist of any number of non-solid stem blocks atop of each other and a single leaf as the uppermost block, which can be stood on by any entity like a normal block for 1 second (20 game ticks). After this time, it tilts down, becoming lower than a block and giving a player warning that it is about to collapse. After a few ticks, it tilts down and becomes temporarily non-solid. When the leaf is powered by redstone, it does not tilt or collapse, however. Powering the stem has no effect. One-block tall big dripleaves can be used to make the player crawl.\u200c[Java Edition  only] If a player is standing inside a big dripleaf when it is fully tilted, and the dripleaf returns to the untilted position, the player is left crawling underneath the leaf. When directly hit with any projectile, the leaf immediately becomes temporarily non-solid. This cannot be prevented by powering it with redstone. Frogs enjoy jumping on big dripleaves, although the dripleaf tilts down and drops the frog.\n\n  Placement\n    Big dripleaves can be placed only on top of clay, coarse dirt, dirt, farmland, grass blocks, moss blocks, mycelium, podzol, rooted dirt, and mud. It is always one block tall when placed.\n\n  Growth\n    Using bone meal on a big dripleaf makes it grow 1 block taller.\n\n",

Soul fire deals more damage than normal fire and does not spread.\n\nObtaining\n    Soul fire cannot be obtained as an item under any circumstances in Java Edition, though in Bedrock Edition soul fire may be obtained as an item via inventory editing.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Soul fire naturally generates in the soul sand valley biome in the Nether. It exclusively generates on soul soil; it does not generate on soul sand within either the same biome[1] nor in the nether wastes biome.[2] Soul fire also generates in ancient cities.\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Soul fire can be placed on soul sand or soul soil using flint and steel or a fire charge. Unlike regular fire, it can only be placed on the top of a block. When placed, a soul fire burns and will not extinguishes by itself. Water that touches soul fire extinguishes it. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[3]\n\n  Burning entities\n    Players and many mobs burn when exposed to soul fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly. While inside a soul fire block, the fire inflicts damage at a rate of 2 per half-second unless the player or mob has Fire Resistance or a total Fire Protection of 7 or higher.\u200c[BE  only] When the player is on fire outside the soul fire block, they take damage at 1 per second[more information needed]. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful difficulty, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the soul fire (stored in a Fire tag shared by all entities). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by powder snow, rain, water or a cauldron.\n\n  Extinguishing\n    Soul fire never extinguishes unless punched or when it receives a block update and finds there is no soul soil or soul sand below it. Punching or hitting a burning block extinguishes the soul fire, making the Fire extinguished sound (see below). Hitting soul fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on the soul fire also extinguishes it. Water and lava extinguish soul fires that they flow into, and thrown splash and lingering water bottles extinguish soul fires in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it.[more information needed] Mobs on fire are extinguished when in water or in a cauldron containing it. In the latter case, one layer of water disappears.\n\n  Piglins\n    Soul fire repels piglins. Like hoglins, they are not fire-resistant, which is unique among Nether mobs.\n\n",

occupy. When placed, a stair orients itself with the half-block side closest to the player. Stairs can be placed either right side up or upside-down: Stairs change their shape to join with adjacent stairs (of any material): Right side up stairs do not join with upside-down stairs and vice versa.\n\n  Walking\n    Walking up stairs is faster than jumping up the same distance. Walking up a stairway doesn't cost any exhaustion from the player's hunger bar, compared to 0.2 exhaustion per jump. Therefore, walking up stairs doesn't make the player hungry at all.\n\n  Behavior\n    Generally, the solid faces of stairs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, transparent blocks that need to placed on an opaque surface can be placed on these faces.\n\n  Fuel\n    Overworld wooden stairs can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Wooden stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds. Stone stairs can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    Powder snow is a block found in snowy slopes and grove biomes, or collected from snowfall using cauldrons.  Players and most mobs fall through powder snow and take freezing damage within it, but leather boots can be worn to stand on and climb through it as well as gain freezing immunity. Powder snow can only be obtained using a bucket.\n\nObtaining\n  Natural generation\n    Powder snow naturally generates in groves and snowy slopes in strip formations. Powder snow can not have a Snow Layer placed on it Powder snow can also naturally generate in certain rooms in trial chambers.\u200c[upcoming]\n\n  Cauldrons\n    A cauldron in a snowy biome under open sky fills with powder snow when it is snowing. Powder snow can then be picked up from this cauldron with an empty bucket.\n\n  Bucket\n    Using a powder snow bucket places powder snow; placed powder snow can be picked up again with an empty bucket. These actions can be automated using a dispenser. When picked up, breaking particles appear.\u200c[Java Edition  only][1]\n\n  Breaking\n    Powder snow does not drop anything when mined, even with Silk Touch, and tools do not speed up mining.[2][3]\n\n    Block,Powder Snow\n\n    Hardness,0.25\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.4\n\n\n    Powder snow is broken by water or lava, or when shot with a Flame-enchanted bow.\n\nUsage\n    Entities (except rabbits, endermites, silverfish, shulkers, vexes and foxes) fall through powder snow without taking fall damage and move much slower in it, similar to cobwebs. Powder snow does not cause suffocation damage. Mobs, armor stands or players wearing leather boots do not fall through powder snow. In this case, the snow behaves as scaffolding when the player sneaks or crouches while on the block and jumps while inside of the block. It is impossible to climb out of powder snow without leather boots. Most walking mobs (except for goats) treat powder snow as normal solid blocks while pathfinding, similar to trapdoors, allowing them to voluntarily walk into it, and fall through it if possible.[4] Goats avoid powder snow, although they are not immune to falling through it and taking freezing damage. If an entity that is on fire touches powder snow, powder snow cools it down as the powder snow melts. Being fully inside a block causes a thick fog effect around the point of view. In Java Edition, players in Spectator mode can see through powder snow without any fogging effect. When powder snow is on top of grass blocks, mycelium or podzol, the blocks below change to a snowy texture, similar to when snow layers are on top;[5] they revert to their default textures when the powder snow is removed. This change can be detected by observers.\n\n  Freezing\n    When an entity is inside a powder snow block, they begin to freeze, taking damage. A player submerged in powder snow sees a frosty vignette slowly fade in at the sides of the screen and the FOV slowly decreases. When the vignette is fully shown, the player begins shivering visibly. After seven seconds (140 game ticks), the player's hearts change to a cyan frosty texture (), and the player begins taking damage at a rate of 1 HP every two seconds (40 game ticks). When an entity dies of freezing damage, a message will appear, saying [entity] froze to death. If the player leaves the powder snow block, the vignette slowly fades away. A frozen player moves slower than usual until the vignette fully fades away. This is controlled by the \"TicksFrozen\" data tag, which increases by 1 every tick (to a maximum of 140) for an entity within the powder snow block. It decreases at a rate of 2 per tick after the entity leaves the powder snow block. This is currently not a separate effect when used with commands such as /effect give freezing, and does not have its own unique art, particles, or potion. Players do not take freezing damage if the game rule freezeDamage is set to false. Wearing any piece of leather armor stops the freezing effect and reverses the damage. This applies to entities that can wear armor, such as players, zombies and horses wearing leather horse armor. If the leather armor is put on while the entity already has the freezing effect, the effect fades away the same as if the entity exited the powder snow. Snow golems, strays, polar bears, withers, and ender dragons[verify] are immune to freezing damage. Fire-related mobs like striders, magma cubes, and blazes take 5 from freezing. Skeletons turn into strays instead of taking freezing damage.\n\n  Preventing fall damage\n    Similar to water, powdered snow resets the fall distance of players and mobs falling into it, and can be used to prevent fall damage. It is superior to water in that it can be used in the Nether. Damage is also negated when falling onto carpet placed over powdered snow.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Despite not being a solid block, powder snow can be pushed and pulled by pistons like most solid blocks. This makes it the only block that can be placed and retrieved by dispensers, while also pushable by pistons.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A potato is a food item obtained from potato crops that can be used to plant them, consumed raw or cooked to make baked potatoes. Potato crops are planted in farmland and used to grow potatoes and, rarely, poisonous potatoes.\n\nObtaining\n  Natural generation\n    Village farm plots have a chance of being planted with potatoes. The exact chance depends on the style of the village:\n\n    Village style,Chance\n\n    Snowy,70%\n\n    Plains,15%\n\n    Taiga,10%\n\n\n    Fully grown potato crops drop 2 to 5 potatoes (3\u00a05\u20447 per crop harvested on average) and have a 2% chance of dropping an additional poisonous potato. Potato yield can be increased using a tool enchanted with Fortune, with Fortune III harvesting an average of 5\u00a03\u20447 potatoes. Bone meal can be used to mature the potato to its last stage of growth. The first two potatoes always drop, and then three more attempts are made to drop a potato with a success rate of 57.14286% to yield the extra 0\u20133 drops. Each level of Fortune enchantment increases the number of attempts by one.\n\n  Mob loot\n    Zombies, husks, and zombie villagers have a 2.5% (1\u204440) chance of dropping either an iron ingot, carrot, or potato when killed by a player or tamed wolf. This is increased by 1% (1\u2044100) per level of looting. This gives potatoes the following chances of dropping: When killed with fire, a zombie drops a baked potato instead.\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Potato,Pillager Outpost,Chest,2\u20135,\"57.5% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"2\u20135\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5750050885406066, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Pillager Outpost\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Shipwreck,Supply\u00a0chest,2\u20136,\"42.1% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"2\u20136\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.42061090139687074, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Shipwreck\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Supply chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Village,Plains\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"74.2% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.7422481146272464, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Plains house chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Snowy\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"66.3% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.662802357880901, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Snowy house chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Taiga\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"65.6% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.6556091848091459, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Taiga house chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bedrock Edition\n\n    Potato,Bonus chest,Chest,1\u20132,\"50% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20132\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bonus chest\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Pillager Outpost,Chest,2\u20135,\"57.5% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"2\u20135\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5750050885406066, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Pillager Outpost\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Shipwreck,Supply\u00a0chest,2\u20136,\"42.1% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"2\u20136\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.42061090139687074, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Shipwreck\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Supply chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Village,Plains\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"74.2% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.7422481146272464, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Plains house chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Snowy\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"66.3% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.662802357880901, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Snowy house chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Taiga\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"69.3% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Potato\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.6929135530018191, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Taiga house chest\"\" }\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Farming\n    When farmed, potatoes require 8 stages to grow. However, there are four visible stages due to having only four distinct textures: every two stages have the same texture, except that growth stage 7 keeps the same appearance as stages 5\u20136, so that only stage 8 has the final, mature appearance. Planted potatoes require a light level of 9 or greater to continue growing. If the light level is 7 or below, the crops instantly un-plant themselves (\"pop off\"). It is not possible to plant potatoes if the light level is too low. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5. Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.\n\n  Food\n    To eat a potato, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating a potato restores 1 () hunger and 0.6 saturation.\n\n  Breeding\n    Pigs follow and can be bred by a player holding a potato. Villagers can pick up potato items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 potatoes to become willing.\n\n  Smelting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Smelting recipe\n\n    Baked Potato,Potato + Any fuel,0.35\n\n\n  Trading\n    Novice-level farmer villagers have a 25%\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] or 40%\u200c[Java Edition  only] chance to buy 26 potatoes for an emerald as part of their trade.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a potato into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. This is less efficient than composting with baked potatoes, which has a higher success chance of 85%.\n\n",

The chance is 2\u20447 in Java Edition.\n\nUsage\n    Unlike most food, the cake cannot be eaten as an item in the hotbar. Before being eaten, it must first be placed on top of a solid block. Placing the cake on a slab also works, as the slab acts like a solid block. The cake instead floats half a block on top of the slab. Each cake has seven \"slices\"; each use consumes one slice progressing inward from the west. A single slice restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation. Eating all seven slices of a cake restores 14 ( \u00d7 7) hunger and 2.8 hunger saturation. Since eating a cake comes with no animation, the cake can be eaten at a rate of one slice per tick. Multiple players can eat from the same cake at the same time. In Java Edition, eating cake makes no sound, unlike other foods. As a redstone component, when connected to a comparator, a whole cake emits a signal strength of 14. The signal strength decreases two units with each slice. Cake destroys falling blocks if placed under them, similar to a torch.\n\n  Pandas\n    Some pandas move toward a dropped cake to pick up and eat it. Some may not, depending on the cake's location.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a cake into a composter raises the compost level by 1.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    A cake is broken when pushed by a piston, and it drops nothing.\n\n  Cakes with candles\n    Using a candle on an uneaten cake creates a candle cake of that color (including uncolored). Eating any of the cake causes the candle to drop. Using flint and steel, fire charge, or any flaming projectile on an unlit candle cake lights its candle. Lit candle cakes emit a light level of 3. Interacting with the lit candle (but not the cake) extinguishes it.\n\n",

They are now unobtainable in vanilla survival.\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Slabs can occupy either the top half or the bottom half of a block, or both: Slabs cannot be oriented vertically.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n  Behavior\n    In Bedrock Edition a single slab (top or bottom) is transparent to light, while a double slab is opaque. The empty half of a slab block is also transparent to mobs, unlike other transparent blocks such as fences and glass, which players can see through but mobs cannot. A bottom placed on top of a hopper is transparent to items; the items fall through the bottom slab into the hopper. Without a hopper attached below, a bottom slab behaves as a solid surface. Falling block entities (like sand, gravel, and concrete powder) turn into their dropped form if they land on a bottom slab, as when they fall on a torch. Mobs see a slab as a full block when pathfinding. They can spawn on top slabs and double slabs, but not on bottom slabs. This can be used to prevent mob spawning in certain areas, such as mob farms. Generally, the top face of top slabs, the bottom face of bottom slabs, and all faces of double slabs are handled as solid blocks. Due to this, blocks that require a solid surface for placement can be placed on these faces. Double slabs are handled as a single block instead of two different slabs; as such, breaking one destroys the whole block and drop two slabs, as opposed to breaking only one slab within the block. \"Double slabs\" that are not aligned to the grid (i.e. a bottom slab on top of a top slab) are handled as separate blocks and are broken individually. Redstone dust placed on a top slab receives signals from redstone dust one block lower and adjacent, but cannot transmit signals down to that block. In Bedrock Edition, mobs standing on bottom slabs with air or another bottom slab below fail to pathfind correctly. They often end up spinning around in a small circle when they try to move. Due to the way blast rays propagate from an explosion, bottom slabs provide extremely effective absorption to explosions directly on top of them. In some cases, only the slab is destroyed from a TNT explosion directly on top of it. Explosions from end crystals and creepers are also weakened. Sneaking reduces the player's hitbox height to 1.5 blocks, allowing the player to fit through such a gap (for example, walking over a bottom slab with one block of air above it, or in a two block high tunnel with an upper slab on the ceiling). A player cannot walk from a block of soul sand directly up to a bottom slab without jumping \u2013 this applies not just to soul sand, but to any block 7\u20448 of a block high or shorter, because the maximum step height of the player is 0.6 of a block. The player can walk off a bottom slab while sneaking, because the sneaking prevents falling only when the distance is higher than one half block. If a single slab is placed in a water source block, or water is placed onto a single slab using a water bucket, the empty half of that slab's block is waterlogged. If a slab is placed in flowing water, a pocket of air is created in the unfilled half of the block. If the player's head is in this pocket, the player can breathe and see as clearly as from an air block. In Java Edition, if a single slab is placed in between two water sources or waterlogged blocks, the slab becomes waterlogged. A minecart on powered rails is not repelled by a slab, although it is repelled by a slab with a minecart on top.\n\n  Fuel\n    Overworld wooden slabs can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.75 items per slab in Java Edition, and 1.5 items per slab in Bedrock Edition.[3] Therefore in Bedrock Edition, wooden slabs (12 items per log) are twice as fuel efficient as wood planks (6 items per log), even more so than charcoal (8 items per log), which needs to be smelted in the first place.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Wooden slabs can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds. Stone slabs can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

A redstone torch is removed and drops as an item if:\n\n  Natural generation\n    A single redstone torch is found inside each igloo.

Placement To place a redstone torch, use the Place Block control while aiming at the surface to which the redstone torch should be attached. A redstone torch can be attached to:\nthe top or side of any full solid opaque block (stone, dirt, blocks of gold, etc.), including full-block mechanism components (command blocks, dispensers, droppers, note blocks, and redstone lamps)\nthe top only or side only of certain block. SeeOpacity/Placement. Redstone torches cannot be attached to the bottoms of any blocks. Attempting to attach a redstone torch to an invalid surface can cause it to \"snap\" to a valid surface adjacent to the same space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a redstone torch to the side of the fence causes the redstone torch to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead. Activation A redstone torch is active unless the block it is attached to is powered. Effectively, a redstone torch inverts the signal applied to its attachment block: power level 0 is changed to 15 and power levels 1 to 15 are changed to 0 (for an alternative that produces a greater range of output power levels, consider a redstone comparator in subtraction mode). Walls, fences, glass, slabs, hoppers, and stairs cannot be powered so redstone torches attached to them cannot be deactivated. A redstone torch takes 1 redstone tick (2 game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag) to change state and usually does not respond to 1-tick fluctuations of power. Behavior While active, a redstone torch:\npowers adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, including beneath the redstone torch if it is attached to the side of a block\npowers adjacent redstone comparators or redstone repeaters facing away from the redstone torch to power level 15\nstrongly powers a full solid opaque block above the redstone torch to power level 15 (but not next to or below it)\nactivates adjacent mechanism components, including above or below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc.\nproduces \"reddust\" particles A redstone torch never affects the block it is attached to, even if it is a mechanism component. For example, a redstone torch attached to a redstone lamp does not activate the lamp. It has to power something like redstone dust for the component to be powered. A redstone torch experiences \"burn-out\" when it is forced to change state (by powering and de-powering the block it is attached to) more than eight times in 60 game ticks (three seconds, barring lag). After burning out, a redstone torch produces a \"smoke\" particle and a hiss similar to an extinguished fire, deactivates, and then ignores attempts to change its state until the number of state changes in the last 60 game ticks drops to fewer than eight\u2014after that it re-activates when it receives a block update (an adjacent block changing its state) or a redstone update that would not normally deactivate the redstone torch. There is no limit on how often a single redstone torch can burn out.\n\n",

They sell 4 carpets of the same color for an emerald.\n\nUsage\n    Carpet has the same visual thickness as a pressure plate. It has a hitbox of 1\u204416 of a block and covers the entire surface of the block it is placed on. This thickness prevents mob spawning. Carpet can be placed on any block, including non-solid blocks, except air and item frame\u200c[Java Edition  only]. When placed on grass or fern, they break and the carpet is placed on the block below. When placed on vines, the topmost block of vines breaks and the carpet is placed on the block below, any vines blocks below the first one don't break. It can even be placed over water blocks, but to do so you must target an adjacent block with a visible hitbox. Carpet can be pushed and pulled by pistons but pops off if pushed onto a hole or pulled downward. It can also break falling sand and gravel. Carpet is an opaque block but does not decrease light going through it. Because of this and the fact that it can be placed on any block, a common decorative strategy is to place carpet on a light-emitting block in the floor, illuminating a room and hiding the light source at the same time. Carpets can be placed on top of fences and walls to allow the player to jump on top of them while still preventing animals and mobs from crossing. This is because mobs do not try jump over fences and walls, even with a carpet above. In Java Edition, if a campfire is placed beneath a beehive to pacify bees, the campfire can be placed below ground and a carpet placed over the campfire to protect bees from the fire. In Bedrock Edition, a carpet over a campfire removes the campfire's pacifying effect on bees. If a carpet is placed so that it lays on top of a hopper, the hopper can still collect items through the carpet. This is because hoppers can collect items from less than a full block above in Java Edition, or less than 3\u20444 of a block above in Bedrock Edition. Carpets can also be placed over other carpets. Mobs are unable to walk over two or more layers of carpets, because the mob's AI treats carpets as if they are air blocks. If a mob stands on a double carpet layer, it stays perfectly still.\u200c[Java Edition  only] Similarly, endermen are unable to teleport onto double carpet layers. Carpets, similar to wool, dampens vibrations from sculk sensors. These include placing, breaking, and entities walking/jumping on. However, unlike wool, carpets dampen only horizontal vibration paths.\n\n  Decorating llamas\n    Llamas can be equipped with carpets in their carpet slot (). Each carpet color shows as a different patterned rug on the llama's back.\n\n  Fuel\n    Carpet can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.335 items per carpet item.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Breaking tall grass and vines\n    When placed on the top half of tall grass or large fern, they break and the carpet drops as an item.\n\n",

This provides a renewable way of obtaining obsidian, as lava can be farmed via cauldrons under pointed dripstone. Obsidian is created when a nether portal is generated in the Nether or the Overworld. This portal can then be mined, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. In Java Edition, if a nether portal is generated midair, 4 extra obsidian is generated at the bottom of the portal. When an entity enters the End via an end portal, it always spawns on a platform consisting of 25 obsidian. This platform can then be mined, and regenerates whenever an entity enters the End, providing another way of obtaining obsidian renewably. Obsidian pillars also regenerate when the ender dragon respawns.\n\nUsage\n    Obsidian is useful for building explosion-resistant structures as it has, along with anvils and netherite blocks, a blast resistance of 1,200; the highest of all blocks obtainable in Survival mode (together with crying obsidian and block of netherite). Obsidian also cannot be destroyed by the ender dragon. However, ender dragons can traverse obsidian blocks without destroying them. These qualities make obsidian an extremely effective defensive block, and it is commonly used in many bases in multiplayer servers as protection from griefers. Obsidian is, however, not immune to the wither. Although black wither skulls has merely the explosive power of a ghast fireball, blue wither skulls ignore blast resistance, which means they can destroy obsidian. The wither's body can also destroy obsidian, either through block-breaking behavior upon taking damage, or its dash attack\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]. The wither is the only mob in the game that can break obsidian. Obsidian is one of the two blocks an end crystal can be placed on; the other is bedrock.\n\n  Nether portals\n    Obsidian is used to create a nether portal frame, which is then ignited using fire. The frame must be a vertical rectangle any size from 4\u00d75 to 23\u00d723. The corners of the frame are not required for an operational portal.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Beacon,Glass + Nether Star + Obsidian,\"[['Glass', 'Glass', 'Glass'], ['Glass', 'Nether Star', 'Glass'], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n    Enchanting Table,Book + Diamond + Obsidian,\"[[None, 'Book', None], ['Diamond', '', 'Diamond'], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n    Ender Chest,Obsidian + Eye of Ender,\"[['', '', ''], ['', 'Eye of Ender', ''], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Obsidian can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Obsidian cannot be pushed by pistons.

They hatch faster when on moss blocks. Sniffer eggs hatch in about 10 minutes on moss blocks, and take twice as long to hatch on non-moss blocks. Sniffer eggs do not need to receive random ticks to hatch.[needs\u00a0testing] Therefore, the hatching speed of sniffer eggs is not affected by the randomTickSpeed game rule.[3]\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Sniffer eggs can be pushed and pulled by pistons.[4]\n\n",

To place a detector rail, use the Place Block control on the face of a block adjacent to the destination space. A detector rail can be attached to: A detector rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the detector rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a detector rail to the side of the fence causes the detector rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead. If updated while on an opened trapdoor, a detector rail (or other rails) breaks drops as an item. Placing a minecart on a detector rail on top of a closed and unpowered trapdoor opens the trapdoor and updates it, causing the detector rail to break. If the trapdoor is powered while the minecart is placed, the trapdoor does not open and the rail does not break. The minecart on the detector rail powers the trapdoor and keeps it closed even if the external power source is removed, allowing the detector rail to stay on. When placed, a detector rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including activator rails, powered rails, and other detector rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, a detector rail lines up in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the detector rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would line up with is one block up, a detector rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, a detector rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails. Mobs avoid walking across a detector rail (or other rails), but can be pushed onto them. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]\n\n  Rail\n    Detector rails (and other rails) act as \"roads\" for minecarts. A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from either end of the detector rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with powered rails). A minecart that enters a detector rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the detector rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted detector rail.\n\n  Redstone component\n    A detector rail activates when any minecart is on it (even if only a portion of the minecart is on it), and deactivates when no minecarts are on it. The duration of the signal is always a multiple of 10 redstone ticks (although lag or unloading/reloading a chunk might affect this). While active, a detector rail: If the minecart on the detector rail is a minecart with chest or minecart with hopper, an adjacent redstone comparator facing away from the detector rail outputs a power level proportional to the container's fullness, possibly power level 0. For any other type of minecart (including a regular minecart with a mob riding it) the comparator's output is zero. A comparator can read the contents of a minecart with hopper or with chest on a detector rail through a solid opaque block, as it can with other container blocks.\n\n  Mob interaction\n    Like other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto detector rails.\n\n",

Hanging signs are also not destroyed by water or lava and therefore may be used to control the flow of these fluids.\n\n  Placement\n    Hanging signs can be placed in three different ways:\n\n  Text\n    Placing a hanging sign opens an editor interface resembling a magnified view of the hanging sign. Up to four lines of text can then be entered using a keyboard (hardware or on-screen). The editor supports limited editing, including moving the cursor and inserting and deleting characters. In Bedrock Edition, formatting codes can also be used to apply decorative effects such as color, bold, italic and underline to various bits of the text. Depending on the edition and platform in use, copy and paste operations may be supported and the editor may also support keyboard entry of Alt-codes for displaying Unicode characters. Text can be added to the back side of a hanging sign by interacting with the that side of the hanging sign after placing it and editing the front. Hanging signs can be waxed by using a honeycomb on it. Once waxed, a sign cannot be unwaxed or edited. After placing and affixing text on a sign, a player can change the text color by using a dye on it. When colored with dye, the text color may differ from any color specified by formatting codes.[more information needed] A player can use a glow ink sac on a sign to make its text glow. The glowing text is not affected by lighting. The player can use a regular black ink sac on the sign to remove the glowing effect.\n\n    Name,Main Color,Edge Color\n\n    Black,#000000,#EDE8CA\n\n    Red,#FC0000,#650000\n\n    Green,#00FC00,#006500\n\n    Brown,#894413,#361B07\n\n    Blue,#0000FC,#000065\n\n    Purple,#9E20ED,#3F0C5F\n\n    Cyan,#00D6D6,#006565\n\n    Light Gray,#D0D0D0,#535353\n\n    Gray,#7E7E7E,#323232\n\n    Pink,#FC68B2,#652947\n\n    Lime,#8DFC00,#4B6500\n\n    Yellow,#FCFC00,#656500\n\n    Light Blue,#98BECB,#3C4B51\n\n    Magenta,#FC00FC,#650065\n\n    Orange,#FC671F,#65280C\n\n    White,#FCFCFC,#656565\n\n\n    In Creative mode, the combination Ctrl + pick block on Windows/Linux, or \u2318 Cmd + pick block on macOS, can be used to copy an already-placed hanging sign, including its text (with decorations), into the player's inventory. A dyed hanging sign facing east or west has text that appears more saturated and bright than a hanging sign facing north or south. However, it is actually the hanging sign that is dimmer, because Minecraft's lighting engine uses side lighting to make the world appear less flat, but the text on hanging signs is not affected by this. In Bedrock Edition, inappropriate words or phrases in a hanging sign's text are displayed as asterisks. In Java Edition, hanging signs can be created with JSON text, which allows complex formatting (colors, bold, italic, etc.), hover and click events, localized translation (for Minecraft technical terms, like \"Redstone Repeater\", otherwise translations must be provided in language files in resource packs), and the incorporation of scoreboard values into text. Use the /data merge block command to create or alter JSON signs. Example: /data merge block ~ ~1 ~ {front_text:{ color:\"green\", messages:[ '{\"selector\":\"@p\", \"bold\":false, \"italic\":false, \"underlined\":false, \"strikethrough\":false, \"obfuscated\":false}' , '{\"text\":\"Second Line\"}']}} Hanging signs can post the success count of JSON text hover and click events to scoreboard objectives. The objectives to be used can be specified by running the /execute store command or by modifying the sign's NBT data directly with the /data merge block command.\n\n  Interaction\n    Hanging signs can be edited after being placed by using them, which opens the edit sign message GUI. Hanging signs are destroyed and drop as an item when pushed by a piston.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Unlike signs, hanging signs are solid and have collision. Water and lava flow around hanging signs. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to hanging signs as if the hanging signs were flammable, but they do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods either, except in Bedrock Edition).\n\n  Fuel\n    Hanging signs can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting an item per hanging sign.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Hanging signs can be placed under note blocks to produce a \"bass\" sound.\n\n",

This effect restores oxygen, gives underwater night vision and increases mining speed by 16.7% (1/6th). Conduits also damage any hostile mobs, like drowned, guardians, and elder guardians, within a range of 8 blocks of the conduit. Conduits can be activated in any biome and at any height or depth. To activate, a conduit needs to be in the center of a 3\u00d73\u00d73 volume of water (source blocks, flowing water, and/or waterlogged blocks), which itself must be enclosed within an activation frame. The frame is built out of blocks in three 5\u00d75 open squares centered on the conduit, one around each axis. Only prismarine, dark prismarine, prismarine bricks, and sea lantern blocks in the frame contribute to activation. A minimum of 16 blocks are required and produce an effective range of 32 blocks. Prismarine-type slabs (including double slabs), stairs, and walls cannot be used to activate the conduit. Any blocks (of any type) that are not part of the activation frame itself but are in the 5\u00d75\u00d75 outer shell likewise have no effect. Once activated, removing any blocks away from the conduit (frame blocks) does deactivate the conduit.[note 1] The effective radius of the conduit is 16 blocks for every seven blocks in the frame, though the effect does not activate until the minimum of 16 blocks is included in the build. Thus, it extends to 48 at 21 blocks, 64 at 28 blocks, 80 at 35 blocks, and 96 with a complete frame of 42 blocks. A complete frame also carries the additional advantage of attacking hostile mobs within 8 blocks of the conduit by 4 every 2 seconds, if they are in contact with water or rain.[note 2] Monsters that are attacked by the conduit:\n\n  Light source\n    Conduits emit a light level of 15, the brightest light level in the game, whether activated or not; including on land.\n\n",

Redstone dust can be placed on opaque blocks as well as glowstone, upside-down slabs, glass, upside-down stairs, and hoppers. It can also be placed on some transparent blocks; see Opacity/Placement for more information. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1] Redstone wire configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone power components and transmission component connection points. Redstone wire also configures itself to point toward adjacent redstone wire one block higher or lower \u2013 unless there is a solid opaque block above the lower redstone wire. If there is only one such adjacent redstone component, redstone wire configures itself into a  line pointing both at the neighbor and away from it. If there are two or more such adjacent components, redstone wire connects them in the form of , , , or  as needed. When there are no adjacent components, a single redstone wire configures itself into a  plus sign, which can provide power in all four directions. By right-clicking, it can be changed into a  dot, which does not provide power to any of the four directions. Redstone wire does not automatically configures itself to point toward mechanism components; the only exception are the back and side faces of pistons and sticky pistons in Bedrock Edition. If such a configuration is desired, the other neighbors of the redstone wire must be arranged to create it, i.e the redstone dust must be placed in a way that it would be pointed at the block\u2019s location even if it were not there. When redstone wire is reconfigured after placement, it does not update other redstone components around it of the change unless that reconfiguration also includes a change in power level or another component provides an update. This can create situations where a mechanism component remains activated when it shouldn't, or vice versa, until it receives an update from something else \u2013 a \"feature\" of redstone wire that can be used to make a block update detector. Redstone wire can transmit power, which can be used to operate mechanism components (doors, pistons, redstone lamps, etc.).\nRedstone wire can be \"powered\" by a number of methods: The \"power level\" of redstone dust can vary from 0 to 15. Most power components power-up adjacent redstone dust to power level 15, but a few (daylight sensors, trapped chests, and weighted pressure plates) may create a lower power level. Redstone repeaters output power level 15 (when turned on), but redstone comparators may output a lower power level. Power level drops by 1 for every block of redstone wire it crosses. Thus, redstone wire can transmit power for no more than 15 blocks. To go further, the power level must be re-strengthened \u2013 typically with a redstone repeater. Powered redstone wire on top of, or pointing at, an opaque block provides weak power to the block. A weakly-powered block cannot power other adjacent redstone wire, but can still power redstone repeaters and comparators, and activate adjacent mechanism components. Transparent blocks cannot be powered. When redstone wire is unpowered, it appears dark red. When powered, it becomes bright red at power level 15, fading to darker shades with decreasing power. Powered redstone wire also produces \"dust\" particles of the same color. While redstone wire always provides power to the directions it points into, it can still point into directions in which it cannot give power. If redstone wire comes in the form of a cross, the player can right-click to toggle it between a cross and dot. A redstone dot does not power anything adjacent to it, but powers the block under it.\n\n",

Over time, a stem grows through several stages[needs testing] and, at its final growth stage, will produce melons on any adjacent dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots. If a melon is already occupying a spot adjacent to a stem it does not grow more melons until the melons is removed. A single stem can grow an unlimited number of melons. Melon stems need a minimum light level of 10 in the block above the stem to grow and give melons. Melon seeds are affected by bone meal only with respect to stem growth; bone meal does not help produce the actual melons.\n\n  Breeding\n    Like other seeds, melon seeds can be used to breed chickens, lead chickens around, and make baby chickens grow up faster by 10% of the remaining time.\n\n  Taming\n    Like other seeds, melon seeds can be used to tame parrots.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing melon seeds into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\nMelon Stem\n    A melon stem is the block that is planted on farmland when melon seeds are used on it. It starts underground, and rises up as the plant grows. The stem is colored green when young, and then yellow once fully grown. The stem curves once a melon has grown from it. A fully-grown single stem connects to any melon in an adjacent square, thus there are 5 possible appearances to a stem. If there are multiple melons it can connect to, it favors the east, then west, north, and south. When the melon is removed, the stem returns to its straight shape.\n\n",

They have an animated texture that consists of glowing spots, but they do not illuminate the surroundings. It has a similar texture of an end portal viewed from above; however, this is not widely recognized as a subject for griefing.\n\n  Spreading sculk charge\n    Sculk blocks allow the charge created by sculk catalysts to travel through them, allowing the charge to convert blocks further away. There are certain conditions required for the sculk catalyst to spread toward other blocks. Spawning Zombie from a spawn egg into Lava located 1 block underneath close to the catalyst does not cause any spread. However, if a sculk block is nearby, it accepts the charge. The sculk charge does not remain forever, regardless of whether it is currently spreading. If a single standing sculk block containing a sculk charge is destroyed, the sculk charge vanishes. The sculk charge generates a sculk sensor or sculk shrieker if it is at least 4 blocks away from the sculk catalyst that created the charge, not to be confused with death location. The sculk charge does not always pick the same route, regardless if there's a sculk vein on a block. The sculk charge does not strictly move in a direction, instead it can loop back and forward before continuing going through a straight line of Sculk Blocks. The sculk charge can not turn blocks into sculk blocks, without going through the process of adding sculk vein to it. It is possible to protect blocks such as soul sand by surrounding them with blocks that it can't convert from all linear directions like iron blocks. However, if something at the top is obstructing the soul sand, it would prevent its function to move things in water up. The sculk charge is controlled by the sculk catalyst, which has its own NBT values. The pos in cursors is required for it to work.\nExample: /data modify block -3 -60 -70 cursors set value [{\"charge\":1,\"decay_delay\":1,\"update_delay\":0,pos:[I;-2,-60,-70]}]\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A redstone repeater is a block that produces a full-strength output signal from its front when its back is powered, with four configurable delay settings. It can also be locked into a power state by its side being directly powered by a repeater or a comparator.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    A redstone repeater can be broken instantly using any tool, or without a tool, and drops itself as an item. To remove a redstone repeater, mine it. A redstone repeater is removed and drops as an item if:\n\n  Natural generation\n    A single redstone repeater is generated naturally in each jungle temple.\nThey also generate in ancient cities.\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Redstone Torch + Redstone Dust + Stone,\"[[None, None, None], ['Redstone Torch', 'Redstone Dust', 'Redstone Torch'], ['Stone', 'Stone', 'Stone']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n    A redstone repeater can be used in four different ways: to \"repeat\" redstone signals back to full strength, delay signals, prevent signals moving backward, or to \"lock\" signals in one state. A repeater can be placed only on top of opaque blocks (dirt, stone, etc.), on top of upside-down slabs, upside-down stairs, furnaces, and glass. In Bedrock Edition, a repeater can also be placed on fences and stone walls. They can also be placed on some transparent blocks. See Opacity/Placement for more information. To place a repeater, use the Place Block control. A redstone repeater has a front and back \u2013 the arrow on the top points to the repeater's front. A repeater also has two small redstone torches on its top \u2013 the color of the torches indicates whether its output is on (dark red when off, bright red when on) and the distance between them indicates the delay the repeater adds to the signal transmission. A repeater is 0.125 (1\u20448) blocks high.\n\n  Signal transmission\n    A repeater transmits signals only from its back to its front, but its behavior can be modified from the side (see signal locking, below). A redstone repeater can be powered by any of the following components at its back: A redstone repeater can power any of the following components at its front: A redstone repeater can activate any mechanism component it is facing. An opaque block powered by a redstone repeater is called \"strongly-powered\" (as opposed to an opaque block \"weakly-powered\" by redstone dust). A strongly-powered opaque block can power adjacent redstone dust, as well as other redstone components.\n\n  Signal repeating\n    A redstone repeater can \"repeat\" a redstone signal, boosting it back up to power level 15. Redstone signals have a maximum power level of 15 and that level drops by 1 for every block of redstone dust the signal travels through. If a signal must travel through more than 15 blocks of redstone dust, a redstone repeater can be used to boost the signal back up to full strength. An extra two blocks of distance can be achieved by placing solid opaque blocks before and after the repeater. While redstone repeaters can allow signals to travel great distances, each always adds some delay to the transmission since the minimum amount of delay is 1 redstone tick (0.1 seconds, barring lag).\n\n  Signal delay\n    When initially placed, a redstone repeater has a delay of one redstone tick (equivalent to two game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag). A repeater's delay can be modified by using the Use Item control. Each use increases the repeater's delay by one redstone tick, to a maximum of four redstone ticks, then back to one redstone tick. Longer delays can be made with multiple repeaters \u2013 for example, a repeater set to 'four' and another to 'one' provides a half-second delay (0.4s + 0.1s = 0.5s). A repeater set to a delay of two to four redstone ticks increases the length of any shorter on-pulse to match the length of the repeater's delay, and suppress any shorter off-pulse. For example, a repeater set to a 4-tick delay changes a 1-tick, 2-tick, or 3-tick on-pulse into a 4-tick on-pulse, and does not allow through any off-pulse shorter than 4 ticks. Although a repeater cannot be set to have a delay of zero, instant repeater circuits are possible (circuits that repeat a signal with no delay). In Bedrock Edition, the first repeater have a delay of zero but the repeater is still showing 1-tick.[more information needed]\n\n  Signal direction\n    A redstone repeater acts as a diode \u2013 it allows redstone signals through in one direction (unlike redstone dust or opaque blocks that can transmit redstone signals in any direction). A diode can be used to protect a redstone circuit from redstone signals feeding back into the circuit from its output, or can be used to isolate one part of a circuit from another.\n\n  Signal locking\n    A redstone repeater can be \"locked\" by another powered redstone repeater facing its side. When locked, the repeater does not change its output (whether powered or unpowered), no matter what the input does. When the side repeater turns back off, the repeater returns to its normal behavior. A repeater can also be locked by a powered redstone comparator facing its side. This offers additional possibilities for locking signals because a comparator's output can be affected from 3 sides as well as by containers. If a repeater is locked again too quickly after unlocking (e.g. the lock is controlled by a fast clock circuit), or the lock and the input are changed only on the same tick (e.g. because they're fed by the same clock and both repeaters have the same delay), the repeater does not switch states.\n\n",

When \"activated\", beacon blocks provide two unique functions:\n\n  Activation\n    In order to activate a beacon, the beacon must meet the following requirements: Pyramids are the structures required to activate beacons. There are four possible pyramid heights. More pyramid levels make more powers available in a wider affected vicinity. The type of mineral block used to build the pyramid is entirely cosmetic and has no functional effect. Several different block types can be mixed without affecting functionality. If the pyramid is damaged so that the beacon deactivates, the previously-set powers resume their effects upon reactivation when the pyramid is repaired. This applies to piston-altered pyramids as well.\n\n    Level,Mineral blocks,Materials,Layers\n\n    1,9,81,\"3\u00d73, beacon\"\n\n    2,34,306,\"5\u00d75, 3\u00d73, beacon\"\n\n    3,83 (1 stack + 19 blocks),747,\"7\u00d77, 5\u00d75, 3\u00d73, beacon\"\n\n    4,164 (2 stacks + 36 blocks),1476,\"9\u00d79, 7\u00d77, 5\u00d75, 3\u00d73, beacon\"\n\n\n    Multiple beacons can make use of the same specific mineral blocks below them. Combined pyramids do not need to be symmetrical. The image to the right shows a 6-beacon (2 by 3) pyramid. It requires a total of 244 mineral blocks, with a base layer of 10 by 11.\n\n    Level,Mineral blocks,Materials,Layers\n\n    1,20,180,\"4\u00d75, beacons\"\n\n    2,62,558,\"6\u00d77, 4\u00d75, beacons\"\n\n    3,134 (2 stacks + 6 blocks),1206,\"8\u00d79, 6\u00d77, 4\u00d75, beacons\"\n\n    4,244 (3 stacks + 52 blocks),2196,\"10\u00d711, 8\u00d79, 6\u00d77, 4\u00d75, beacons\"\n\n\n  Beam\n    A vertical beam appears from a beacon if the beacon is activated, extending from the beacon block up to beyond the top of the world. The color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of stained glass (or stained glass panes) anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as those for the corresponding dye. This also works using hardened stained glass and hardened stained glass panes.\u200c[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only] Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks. The resulting beam color can be found as C=12n+1(c0+\u2211i=1n2i\u22121ci)where ci is the sequence of glass colors (c0 corresponds to the lowest block and cn to the highest one). As the blending algorithm is considerably simpler than that of leather-dyeing, a much larger part of the sRGB space is available.[more information needed] A player may experiment with stacking glass, although programs that calculate combinations are also available.[2] Beacon beams cannot go through most blocks, but can go through bedrock (to allow beacons to be used in the Nether) and end portal frames. Using just 15 colors of stained glass, It is possible to make all colors, for example; red + white stained glass above a beacon makes pink; in addition to this, the more white that is added, the lighter the color.\n\n  Powers\n    Once the beacon is emitting a beam, it can then be fed one iron ingot, gold ingot, emerald, diamond, or netherite ingot to select the status effects given to players within range of the beacon. This is done through the beacon's GUI, displayed by pressing use while looking at the beacon block. It doesn't matter which of the items is fed into the beacon. In the GUI, the player places the item to be fed in the empty slot and clicks an effect from the \"Primary Power\" section on the left. If the beacon is sitting on a 4-level pyramid, the \"Secondary Power\" section on the right also becomes active. The player can then choose either to turn on the Regeneration power in addition to the Primary Power or to raise the primary power to Level II. The user clicks the \"Done\" button (green checkmark), the item is consumed, and the power(s) become activated. To change the beacon's powers, this process must be followed again, consuming another ingot or gem. If the pyramid is broken, effects deactivate or weaken depending on the level of the pyramid that is no longer complete. Upon restoration of the pyramid, the originally selected power returns without the need to spend another item. The five Primary Powers are: The Secondary Powers available with a 4-level pyramid are: Regeneration I: Regenerates health. It is also possible to combine two different primary Level I powers\u200c[Java Edition  only]: Only one of the two powers appear to be selected, although both effects are active.[3] Every four seconds, the selected powers are applied with a duration of 9 seconds, plus 2 seconds per pyramid level, to all players in range. Thus, when powers are changed or a player travels outside the area-of-effect, the powers persist for 5\u20139 seconds, or 13-17 seconds with a full pyramid. The beacon affects an area in the shape of a square column, which reaches downward and out to each side at a range determined by the size of the pyramid base (see table below), and upward a distance of that range + 384 blocks. The range of the beacon effect is limited by the simulation distance. As such, on simulation distance of 4 with a level 4 pyramid, the effect does not reach the chunks on the corners of the beacon range. The distance from the player to the beacon block does not affect the intensity of the status effect.\n\n    Pyramid size,Effect range (blocks),Effect duration (seconds)\n\n    1 level,20,11\n\n    2 levels,30,13\n\n    3 levels,40,15\n\n    4 levels,50,17\n\n\n  Light source\n    Beacon blocks can function as light sources, emitting a light level 15. Like other light sources, they melt snow and ice.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Beacons cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons or sticky pistons.\n\n",

A soul campfire drops soul soil, and either one also drops any items placed on it. If mined with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, the soul campfire instead drops itself as an item.

Soul campfires are lit by default when placed. Soul campfires can be manually lit by using or dispensing flint and steel on them, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when /gamerule mobGriefing is true. In Bedrock Edition, soul campfires can also be lit by using an item enchanted with fire aspect, or stepping on it while burning. Soul campfires can be extinguished by waterlogging it (placing water in the same block space), throwing a splash water bottle on it, or using a shovel on it. Soul campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face.\u200c[JE  only][1] In Bedrock Edition, soul campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the soul campfire. As with torches, rain does not extinguish soul campfires.[2] Using flint and steel on the side of a waterlogged or lit soul campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead. Any items cooking on a soul campfire always drop when the soul campfire block is broken.\n\n  Particles and smoke signals\n    Unlike regular campfires, soul campfires do not emit embers.[3]\n\n  Damage\n    Soul campfires damage mobs standing on top of them even if underwater (with exceptions such as shulkers, zombified piglins or guardians), but only if lit. Soul campfires deal 2 of damage every tick (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second). Soul campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is considered fire damage and is reduced by armor (which loses durability), the Resistance potion effects, and the Protection and Fire Protection enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a potion of fire resistance or wearing Frost Walker boots. Regardless of height, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above soul campfires. The soul campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.\n\n  Cooking\n  Hoppers\n    Soul campfires do not have an external inventory. Raw food cannot be loaded into the soul campfire with a hopper. A hopper placed directly underneath a soul campfire pulls through any items dropped into the soul campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the soul campfire get pulled into the hopper.\n\n  Bees\n    Placing a soul campfire under a beehive or bee nest allows players to harvest honey bottles or honeycomb without provoking the bees.\nThere must be unobstructed air between the soul campfire and the beehive or bee nest. Carpets are an exception.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Piglins\n    Lit soul campfires repel piglins that are not currently attacking. This occurs when the piglin is within an 8 block radius of the soul campfire.\n\n  Light source\n    Soul campfires emit a light level of 10. Due to their lower light level, soul campfires do not melt snow or ice.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Soul campfires can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n  Converting soul sand to soul soil\n    Soul campfires can be used to convert soul sand into soul soil. If a soul campfire is crafted using soul sand, placed, and then broken without Silk Touch, that soul campfire drops soul soil.[4]\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    In Bedrock Edition, pushing a soul campfire with a piston or sticky piston breaks it. Soul campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons. In Java Edition, pistons do not interact with soul campfires. Soul campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.\n\n",

The light block is also the only light-emitting block capable of producing light level 8.\u200c[until JE 1.21\u00a0& BE 1.21]\n\nObtaining\n    Light blocks cannot be mined, similar to air, and can be targeted only if the player is holding a Light item in the main hand. Light blocks with a light level of 0 are functionally identical to air. They do not attach to any block, meaning that breaking an adjacent block does not remove the light block. However, they can be broken by replacing them with another block.[1] The exception is water (including, in Bedrock Edition, flowing water), which can occupy the same space as a light block. See Waterlogging for more information. In Java Edition, light blocks are available in the Creative inventory. Across both Java and Bedrock editions, they can also be obtained by using commands such as /give. In Bedrock Edition, specifying the data value from 0 to 15 determines the block's light level; if the data value is not specified, the light block emits a light level of 0. The command is: /give <target> light_block [amount: int] [data: int (0 - 15)] [components: json]. In Java Edition, using /give <target> minecraft:light{BlockStateTag:{level:\"<int>\"}} can give a light block with a specific light level and corresponding texture. If the level is below 0, the non-bulb texture is used, and above 15 the level 15 texture. If the block state is not specified or not between 0 and 15, the light block emits a light level of 15.\n\nUsage\n    A light block is intended for use in adventure maps. Each light block (as a block or as an item) has an associated light level, which can be anything from 0 to 15. In the player's inventory, light blocks display their light level in the top-left corner and appear \"brighter\" at higher light levels. Light blocks have a hitbox only when a light block is selected in the main hand; the particle appears only when selected in the main hand in creative mode, similar to barriers. When pressing use on a light block while a light block is held in the main hand, the light level of the light block increases by one, if the light level is already 15, it resets to 0. Light blocks are detected by observers and can be waterlogged. It can be pushed and pulled by pistons.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]\n\n  Light source\n    Light blocks produce their associated light level.\n\n",

In both Java Edition and Bedrock Edition, poppies can be found in the following biomes: In Java Edition, poppies can also generate in many additional biomes: In Java Edition, the following additional biomes are also technically allowed to generate poppies, although they very rarely or never generate grass blocks on the surface in normal worlds. As a result, poppies can generate only in edge cases or custom worlds. Natural poppies are found in plains, savanna, and taiga villages, as well as snowy villages in Bedrock Edition. Potted poppies can also generate in woodland mansions.\n\n  Post-generation\n    When bone meal is applied to a grass block in one of the biomes listed above, poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15\u00d75\u00d715 area. When bone meal is applied to a grass block in plains, sunflower plains, and flower forest, poppies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7\u00d75\u00d77 area. When bone meal is applied to a poppy that has been placed on top of a grass block, more poppies appear on top of nearby grass blocks. Dandelions can also occasionally appear, and poppies can occasionally appear when bone meal is applied to dandelions. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7\u00d77 square.\n\n  Mob loot\n    Iron golems drop 0 to 2 poppies upon death. This is unaffected by the Looting enchantment. Endermen can pick up poppies, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.

When placed, a fence gate automatically faces toward the player who placed it, regardless of any other fences around it. A fence gate can be placed whether there is a solid block beneath it or not. Fences, nether brick fences and walls connect to fence gates, but glass panes and iron bars do not. A fence gate floats in mid-air when placed with no connection to anything else.\n\n  Barrier\n    A fence gate can be opened or closed by using it. When a fence gate opens or closes, it immediately changes its orientation without affecting anything in the space it \"passes through\"\u2014moving fence gates don't push entities the way that pistons do. When opened by hand, a fence gate always opens away from the player. Although a fence gate appears to be only one block tall, a closed fence gate is a barrier one and a half blocks high. Most mobs cannot jump over a fence gate, and entities on top of the fence gate stand half a block above it. An open fence gate is completely non-solid, similar to a sign or a torch.[1] Multiple open fence gates next to each other can be passed through as if the entire space is open. Hostile mobs recognize closed fence gates as a block and cannot detect players through it unless they were already detected. The sound of opening and closing of a fence gate can be heard up to 16 blocks away, like most mob sounds.\n\n  Redstone component\n    A fence gate can be controlled with redstone power. A fence gate is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by: When activated, a fence gate opens immediately. When deactivated, a fence gate closes immediately. An activated fence gate can still be closed by a player, and won't re-open until it receives a new activation signal. (That is, if a fence gate has been closed \"by hand\", it still needs to be deactivated and then reactivated to open by redstone). Fence gates can be moved by pistons. When an activated fence gate is moved by a piston to a position where it shouldn't be activated, it doesn't change its state until it receives a redstone update.\n\n  Fuel\n    Overworld wooden fence gates can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per fence gate.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Fence gates can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n  Helmet\n    While a fence gate cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear as eyeglasses.\n\n",

Upgrading to netherite requires a netherite upgrade smithing template, a diamond tool or a piece of diamond armor, and a netherite ingot.\n\n    Ingredients,Smithing recipe\n\n    Netherite Upgrade + Any Diamond Gear + Netherite Ingot,input:Smithing Template; Diamond Helmet; Diamond Chestplate; Diamond Leggings; Diamond Boots; Diamond Sword; Diamond Pickaxe; Diamond Axe; Diamond Shovel; Netherite Ingot; Netherite Helmet; Netherite Chestplate; Netherite Leggings; Netherite Boots; Netherite Sword; Netherite Pickaxe; Netherite Axe | output:Netherite Shovel\n\n\n    Decorative trims can be applied to any piece of armor - including turtle shells - by using an armor trim smithing template and a trim material. After trimming, the armor will show a decorative pattern corresponding to the smithing template with the color determined by the used material. A preview of this pattern can be seen on an armor stand model, located on the right side of smithing table's GUI.\n\n    Ingredients,Smithing recipe\n\n    Any Armor Trim + Any Armor Piece + Any trim material,input:Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Smithing Template; Netherite Helmet; Iron Chestplate; Golden Leggings; Diamond Boots; Chainmail Chestplate; Leather Pants; Turtle Shell; Amethyst Shard; Copper Ingot; Diamond; Emerald; Gold Ingot; Iron Ingot; Lapis Lazuli; Nether Quartz; Netherite Ingot; Redstone Dust; Diamond; Emerald; Lapis Lazuli; Redstone Dust; Amethyst Trim Netherite Helmet; Copper Trim Iron Chestplate; Diamond Trim Golden Leggings; Emerald Trim Diamond Boots; Gold Trim Chainmail Chestplate; Iron Trim Leather Pants; Lapis Trim Turtle Shell; Quartz Trim Netherite Helmet; Netherite Trim Iron Chestplate; Redstone Trim Golden Leggings; Diamond Trim Diamond Boots; Emerald Trim Chainmail Chestplate; Lapis Trim Leather Pants | output:Redstone Trim Turtle Shell\n\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village contains a smithing table that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who hasn't already chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to toolsmith.

To move items between the barrel inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the barrel interface is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding \u21e7 Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the barrel to the extent that space is available for them.\u200c[Java Edition  only] To exit the barrel interface, use the Esc control. By default, the interface of a barrel is labeled \"Barrel\". A barrel's GUI label can be changed by naming the barrel in an anvil before placing it or by using the /data command\u200c[Java Edition  only] (for example, to label a chest at (0,64,0) as \"Bonus Barrel!\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Bonus Barrel!\"'}). In Java Edition, a barrel can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a barrel's Lock tag is not blank, the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a barrel at (0,64,0) so that the barrel cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Barrel Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Barrel Key\"}.\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village has a barrel that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager who does not have a chosen job site block has a chance to change their profession into a fisherman.\u200c\n\n  Fuel\n    Barrels can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Barrels can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins become hostile toward players who open or break barrels.\n\n",

Breaking the crop before it matures drops the pitcher pod, while breaking the final stage produces a pitcher plant and does not yield the pod. Pitcher crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops.

This includes arrows, tridents, eggs, snowballs, splash potions, fire charges fired by a dispenser, firework rockets, lingering potions, bottles o' enchanting, ender pearls, shulker bullets, flying players[1], and llama spit. The closer a projectile is to the center of the block, the stronger the redstone signal that is produced.\n\n  Redstone component\n    When struck by most projectiles, the target emits redstone power for 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds). Arrows and tridents instead cause the target to emit power for 10 redstone ticks (1 second), similar to stone buttons. A target can be hit with any of the projectiles mentioned above. The strength of the signal depends on how close the projectile is to the center of the block, from 1 to 15. The target also provides a block update when hit, meaning that an observer can detect if the target has been hit and has produced a redstone signal.\u200c[Java Edition  only][2] When used as part of a redstone circuit, a target has the unique property that, though being an opaque block that is not a mechanism component, still can redirect adjacent redstone dust to point to itself.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A crafter is a low-capacity storage block used for automatic crafting. The inventory acts as a crafting table but only crafts when powered and ejects the crafted item (or items) from its \"face\" into the world or into a container it is facing. Its inventory slots can be individually locked to prevent hoppers, droppers, etc. from filling them; crafting recipes treat locked slots as empty of items.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Block,Crafter\n\n    Hardness,1.5\n\n    Tool,Pickaxe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,2.25\n\n    Wooden,1.15\n\n    Stone,0.6\n\n    Iron,0.4\n\n    Diamond,0.3\n\n    Netherite,0.25\n\n    Golden,0.2\n\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Iron Ingot + Crafting Table + Redstone Dust + Dropper,\"[['Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot'], ['Iron Ingot', 'Crafting Table', 'Iron Ingot'], ['Redstone Dust', 'Dropper', 'Redstone Dust']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Container\n    A crafter has nine slots of inventory space, arranged in a 3-by-3 grid like a crafting table. Its GUI can be accessed by using it. A slot can be enabled or disabled, which can be toggled by clicking on it when empty. Disabled slots cannot have items put in them. Hoppers, droppers and other crafters interact with crafters by inserting items into its inventory; hoppers can remove ingredients as well. The added items are distributed from the top left to the bottom right of the enabled slots if there is an empty slot, if the crafter has all item slots filled then items are added to the lowest count item stack of the same type.[1] Hoppers and droppers can interact with all sides of the crafter, and prioritize filling empty spaces, followed by the smallest stack of the item.\n\n  Redstone component\n    When a crafter receives a redstone signal, one item is crafted using the ingredients from the nine inventory slots. The crafted items are subsequently spit out from the front of the crafter. If the front of a crafter is facing a container (including another crafter), the crafted items are transferred into the container. If the container it is facing is full, or the item cannot be inserted into the container, the crafter spits out the item instead. Crafters interact with containers similar to droppers. If a recipe has byproducts (e.g. empty bottles for honey blocks or empty buckets for cake) those will be spit out after the crafted item. For shaped recipes, the position of the items in the inventory matters. Because disabled slots prevent items from entering the slot, crafters can be used to craft any item in the game automatically without any input from the player, using a series of hoppers and/or droppers and the correct configuration of disabled slots for the recipe. A hopper placed below a crafter collects the ingredients from the crafting grid, not the resulting item. In Java Edition, unlike dispensers and droppers, crafters aren't affected by quasi-connectivity. Comparators can emit a redstone signal when reading from a crafter. The signal strength is equal to the number of crafting slots that are either disabled or occupied by an item. [2] An empty crafter with no disabled slots does not output any signal through a comparator. A crafter with every slot either disabled or containing at least one item outputs a signal strength of nine through a comparator.\n\n",

Infested blocks take less time to break than their normal counterparts. When breaking them with a pickaxe, they take half as much time to break as their normal counterparts. When mined with anything other than a Silk Touch-enchanted tool, an infested block drops nothing and spawns a silverfish that immediately attacks the player. If the player attacks a silverfish directly with a sword, bow, or potion of Harming, or when a silverfish takes Poison damage, nearby infested blocks break, spawning more aggressive silverfish. If the silverfish is killed in one hit, then nearby infested blocks do not break, and no silverfish spawn from them.[1] When mined with a tool enchanted with Silk Touch, however, the equivalent non-infested block is dropped without spawning a silverfish on all game difficulties.[2] Any Silk Touch-enchanted tool (including swords) will cause an infested block to drop its non-infested equivalent (that is, a pickaxe is not required). A player wishing to collect stone bricks from a stronghold safely should use Silk Touch-enchanted pickaxes.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Infested stone bricks are occasionally found in strongholds and igloo basements in place of normal stone bricks. Infested mossy and chiseled stone bricks also spawn in igloos, but they do not generate naturally in strongholds.[3] Infested cobblestone is found in the rarely generated \"End portal\" room in woodland mansions. Infested stone and deepslate can generate in the Overworld in the form of blobs. Infested blocks attempt to generate 14 times per chunk in ore features of size 0-13\u200c[JE  only]/0-10\u200c[BE  only], from altitudes -64 to 63 in Java Edition or 0 to 64 in Bedrock Edition, within one of the following biomes, or within a chunk that is at least partially occupied by one of these biomes: Infested stone blob can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, polished andesite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], polished diorite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], polished granite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], tuff\u200c[JE  only], and deepslate. If it replaces tuff or deepslate, it becomes infested deepslate.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Infested blocks are generated when a silverfish enters the respective normal block form.\n\nUsage\n    When mined, an infested block spawns a silverfish that immediately attacks the player. If the player attacks a silverfish directly with a sword, bow, or potion of Harming, or when a silverfish takes poison damage, nearby infested blocks break, spawning more aggressive silverfish. If the silverfish is killed in one hit, then nearby infested blocks do not break, and no silverfish spawn from them.\n\n  Identifying\n    Note blocks placed on infested blocks produce flute sounds\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] or harp sounds\u200c[Java Edition  only], while those placed on the non-infested stone, cobblestone, or stone bricks produce bass drum sounds. In Bedrock Edition, a player can distinguish infested from normal blocks by observing that an infested block takes a bit faster to break when using a pickaxe than the stone it appears to be, but without a pickaxe, it still breaks faster. A silverfish does not spawn if the block is destroyed by the ender dragon. In Java Edition, using the debug screen, a player can identify whether or not a block is infested.\n\n",

In Java Edition, they are also available in the creative inventory if cheats are enabled.\n\nUsage\n    Structure voids can be placed as part of a structure and are ignored when the structure file is loaded. This results in the blocks at the location where the structure is placed being maintained and not being overridden. For example, if a player saves a 2 block high structure with air at the top and a structure void at the bottom, and loads it into a 2 block high area of stone, the top block becomes air but the bottom stays stone. In Java Edition, structure void blocks have no collision box but have a small hitbox. Additionally, they are invisible, but are displayed as pink cubes when \"Show invisible blocks\" is turned on in Save mode inside a Structure Block. Blocks can also replace structure voids similarly to snow and grass. A piston can move a structure void, but the structure void pushed by the piston will turn into air. In Bedrock Edition, structure void block's hitboxes are the same as a full block, and, similar to barriers, appear when held by the player. Unlike Java Edition, they can support blocks such as signs, torches, rails and redstone wire. A piston cannot move a structure void. As there is no collision box, entities can pass through, although liquids cannot.\n\n",

It is the counterpart to the blast furnace, which is used to quickly smelt ores, metal tools and armor. When a food item and a fuel item are placed into the smoker, the block state changes to lit and the item cooks. Fuel is used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items cooked per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by pressing use on the smoker or by collecting the output using a hopper. Smokers cannot cook chorus fruit, as popped chorus fruit is not edible.\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village has a smoker that has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby villager who hasn't chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to butcher.\n\n  Light source\n    Smokers emit a light level of 13 when active, just like normal furnaces.\n\n  Custom name\n    By default, the interface of a smoker is labeled \"Smoker\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command\u200c[Java Edition  only].\n\n  Lock\n    In Java Edition, a smoker can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a smoker's Lock tag is not blank, the smoker cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a smoker at (0,64,0) so that the smoker cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Smoker Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Smoker Key\"}.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Smoker can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

They can be planted on end stone in any dimension. Chorus flowers can be pollinated by bees.\n\n  Farming\n    Chorus flowers can be planted on end stone and grow in any dimension, regardless of light level. A flower stops growing once it has reached age 5 (appearing purple rather than white), but may be harvested and replanted to reset the age.  Chorus flowers do not grow if planted 1 block below the surface of the ground.\n\n  Placement and growth\n    Placement Chorus flowers must be above end stone or chorus plant, or be above air and horizontally adjacent to exactly one chorus plant. If these conditions are not met, the block breaks without dropping anything. Growth conditions and algorithm Each block tick until the flower reaches age 5, the flower attempts to grow if the block above is air. The flower does not age if growth is not attempted due to lack of an air block above. Bone meal has no effect on growth.[1] The flower may attempt to grow upward depending on the structure of chorus plant blocks directly beneath: The growth attempt succeeds if the blocks horizontally adjacent to and above the target block above are all air, and results in the target block becoming a flower block with the same age while the existing flower block turns to chorus plant. If upward growth does not occur and the flower's age is less than 4, the flower may attempt to branch horizontally. 1\u20134 branches are attempted on an unbranched plant or 0\u20133 on a branched plant. For each branch a horizontal direction is chosen at random, and if the block in that direction is an air block with more air blocks on all other horizontal sides and an air block below, it is replaced with a flower with age incremented by 1. If at least one branch succeeds, the original flower block is turned to chorus plant. Upon a successful growth attempt, the chorus flower emits a low-pitched sound, similar to the sound endermen emit when teleporting. If no growth occurs on a growth attempt, the flower's age is set to 5. Flowers and plant height The amount of chorus flowers a player gets from a fully and unrestricted grown chorus plant ranges from 1 to 8, averaging at around 3.7 flowers per plant. Plant heights range from 5 to (rarely) 22 above the end stone block on which the original chorus flower was planted, with over half falling in the range 13\u201316. Flower heights range from 3 to (rarely) 22, with over half falling in the range 11\u201316 above the end stone block.\n\n",

A wither skeleton skull is always dropped by a wither skeleton if it dies due to a charged creeper's explosion.

This overlays the second layer of the player's skin. Unlike other heads and skulls, wearing a wither skeleton skull does not reduces the detection range for wither skeletons. In Bedrock Edition, wearing a wither skeleton skull makes the player invisible to other players on a locator map.\n\n  Withers\n    Withers can be spawned by placing soul sand or soul soil in a T shape, and putting 3 wither skeleton skulls on top of the T.

Upon entering a ladder's area of effect, the player's speed is reduced instantly to normal ladder descent speed and no damage is taken. Falling onto the narrow top surface of the ladder incurs falling damage as normal. Holding the sneak key while climbing a ladder causes the player to grab hold of the ladder and not fall off. While the player is holding on to a ladder, mining speed decreases. Any mob can climb a ladder in the same way a player does: by pushing against it. Mobs are not smart enough to use ladders deliberately \u2014 they do not remain on a ladder to get somewhere, but a ladder directly in their path lets them climb up.\n\n  Placement\n    Ladders can be placed on any full solid block face. Ladders displace lava blocks to create an air pocket and can be used instead of glass to let lava light shine through a ceiling. They also displace flowing water, but a ladder placed inside a water source block becomes waterlogged and does not create an air pocket.\n\n  Climbing\n    A ladder takes effect whenever the player's lower half is in the block occupied by a ladder. These effects are: Additionally:\n\n  Fuel\n    A ladder can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per ladder.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n",

Zombies have a 5% chance to spawn with the ability to break doors. Vindicators spawned from a raid in Normal and Hard difficulty can also break wooden doors, but they do so only to reach targeted players, villagers, or wandering traders. Some vindicators may sometimes open a wooden door instead of breaking it.\u200c[Java Edition  only] Both zombies and vindicators attempt to break wooden doors only when in their \"closed\" state, even if a door is placed so that its \"open\" state blocks access (for example, by facing sideways when placing a door so that it allows passage when closed and blocks passage when open).\n\n  Redstone component\n    Wooden doors can be controlled with redstone power. A wooden door is a redstone mechanism component and can be activated by  weakly powering any cardinally adjacent block. When activated, the wooden door immediately opens.

The placement of scaffolding is different from any other blocks in the game. In Java Edition, when holding scaffolding, the hitbox of scaffolding in the world is a full block. In Bedrock Edition, the hitbox of scaffolding in the world is not a full block even when holding a scaffolding, so the player can hit/interact with other blocks through the scaffolding. But when being hit, the scaffolding's interaction box is a full block. The placing scaffolding may fall as a falling block if not adequately supported. Scaffolding can be placed up to 6 blocks out from the base of support (i.e. scaffolding block on a solid block) that is targeted; any further scaffolding placed falls to the ground unless able to be supported by a different scaffolding block. Only one additional block can be placed after 6 blocks, even if more would be able to be placed. Scaffolding has different collision detection. The player can climb up or down by jumping or sneaking respectively. in Java Edition, floating scaffoldings has solid bottom. A scaffolding block can be moved by pistons, allowing them to be broken easily. Scaffolding can be waterlogged. In Bedrock Edition, scaffolding cannot be placed inside lava; if scaffolding is placed next to lava or fire, the scaffolding is destroyed. If it falls into lava or fire, it is destroyed immediately. In Java Edition, scaffolding is not ignited by lava, and can be placed inside. It will be destroyed by fire. Mobs don't spawn on scaffolding. In Bedrock Edition mobs can spawn inside of scaffolding if the block below the scaffolding is spawnable. In Java Edition very small mobs such as chickens can spawn in the empty space inside of a scaffolding block if the block below is spawnable. Scaffolding resets the fall distance of players falling into it only while sneaking, and can be used to prevent fall damage. While in scaffolding, the speed of all mobs and players is decreased.\n\n  Fuel\n    Scaffolding can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.25 items per block.\n\n",

Looting increases the drop by 1 per level.\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Bamboo,Jungle temple,Chest,1\u20133,\"51% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Bamboo\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20133\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5097535152939056, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Jungle temple\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Shipwreck,Supply\u00a0chest,1\u20133,\"14.4% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Bamboo\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20133\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.14367923534041638, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Shipwreck\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Supply chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bedrock Edition\n\n    Bamboo,Jungle temple,Chest,1\u20133,\"50.9% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Bamboo\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20133\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5089233125982084, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Jungle temple\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Shipwreck,Supply\u00a0chest,1\u20133,\"14.4% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Bamboo\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20133\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.14367923534041638, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Shipwreck\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Supply chest\"\" }\"\n\n\n  Fishing\n    Bamboo can be found while fishing in jungle biomes as a junk item.\n\nUsage\n    When broken, any bamboo block placed or grown above it is also broken. A bamboo block drops itself as an item if a piston pushes it or moves a block into its space. When bamboo is first placed as a shoot it's not solid and can be destroyed by water flowing into it. After growing at least one block taller it becomes solid and can't be destroyed by water. To transform a bamboo shoot into a solid bamboo block place another bamboo on top of it. Unlike most plants, bamboo cannot be composted.[3]\n\n  Farming\n    Bamboo can be planted on moss blocks\u200c[JE  only], grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, gravel, mycelium, podzol, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, suspicious gravel, mud, bamboo shoot, or on itself. At default random tick speed (3), each plant grows on average every 4096 game ticks (204.8 seconds). When bone meal is used on it, it grows by 1\u20132 blocks. Bamboo can grow up to 12\u201316 blocks tall. The top of a bamboo plant requires a light level of 9 or above to grow. Because bamboo breaks in almost the same way as sugar canes, a sugar cane farm can be easily adapted to this use. While water is not needed with such a farm, some spacing is recommended if the harvest is done manually as mature stalks are solid.\n\n  Pandas\n    Bamboo items are eaten by pandas and can be used to speed up the growth of baby pandas. Bamboo can also be used to breed pandas when at least 8 bamboo blocks are within 5 blocks of the pandas, making the panda the only animal in the game to have extra breeding requirements. At this point, the player\u00a0can feed them bamboo and they mate to have a baby.\n\n  Fuel\n    Bamboo can be used as fuel for smelting. Each bamboo item smelts 0.25 items. Crafting two bamboo into a stick and using that as fuel is equivalent, smelting 0.5 items. Bamboo can be crafted into other items to increase its fuel efficiency.\n\n  Flower pots\n    Bamboo can be placed in a flower pot, where it retains the design it has in its item form.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Block of Bamboo,Bamboo,\"[['', '', ''], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]\",Cannot be crafted back into 9 bamboo.\n\n    Scaffolding,Bamboo + String,\"[['', 'String', ''], ['', None, ''], ['', None, '']]\",\n\n    Stick,Bamboo,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, '', None]]\",\n\n\nAppearance\n    The appearance of bamboo changes as it grows. When first placed, it takes the form of a small shoot, which has no hitbox. When it grows one block taller it grows to 2 pixels in length and width and the top block has leaves coming off it. At 3 blocks, the top 2 blocks have leaves and at 4 blocks the bamboo expands to 3\u00d73 pixels. At 5 blocks tall, the top 3 blocks have leaves on them. As the bamboo grows, the leaves move up and stay at the top 3 blocks. Destroying a block of bamboo does not change the appearance of the blocks below it. Bamboo is oriented at a random position in the block that it is in.\n\n",

Using it inverts it, causing it instead to output a redstone signal based on the darkness of the sky.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Daylight detectors can be broken fairly easily by hand, but can be broken faster by using an axe.

A daylight detector is 0.375 blocks high (3/8ths of a block). Daylight detectors can be moved by pistons.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Water and lava flow around daylight detectors without affecting them. Placement\nTo place a daylight detector, use the \"Use Item/Place Block\" control. A daylight detector can be \"inverted\", which reverses the power levels produced by the daylight detector. To invert a daylight detector, aim at the placed daylight detector and use the \"Use Item/Place Block\" control. Activation\nA daylight detector activates when exposed to sufficient daylight (daylight detector mode) or when exposure to daylight is low enough (inverted daylight detector mode). Sources of block light (torches, glowstone, etc.) cannot activate a daylight detector. Behavior\nAn active daylight detector:\npowers adjacent redstone dust, including below it, and redstone comparators facing away from the daylight detector, to a power level that depends on the time of day, the weather, and the internal sky light level (see tables below)\npowers adjacent redstone repeaters facing away from the daylight detector to power level 15\nactivates adjacent redstone mechanisms, including above and below, such as pistons, redstone lamps, etc. A daylight detector has no effect on other adjacent blocks (for example, it cannot power a block the way a repeater can). The output signal of daylight detectors in the loaded chunk is updated every 20 gametime\u200c[JE  only]/daytime\u200c[BE  only]. Block update have no effect on daylight detectors. The daylight detector power level depends on the time of day, the weather, and the internal sky light level.\n\n    Power,Clear,Rain or Snowfall,Thunder\n\n    Time \u2193,Time \u2191,Time \u2193,Time \u2191,Time \u2193,Time \u2191\n\n    0,\"13,670\u2013(Midnight/18,000)-22,330 (8,660 Gtk/7:13)\",\"13,670-(Midnight/18,000)\u201322,330 (8,660 Gtk/7:13)\",\"13,670-(Midnight/18,000)\u201322,330 (8,660 Gtk/7:13)\"\n\n    1,\"22,331\u201322,781 (450 Gtk/22.5 sec)\",\"13,219\u201313,669 (450 Gtk/22.5 sec)\",\"22,331\u201322,798 (467 Gtk/23.35 sec)\",\"13,203\u201313,669 (466 Gtk/23.3 sec)\",\"22,331\u201322,943 (612 Gtk/30.6 sec)\",\"13,058\u201313,669 (611 Gtk/30.55 sec)\"\n\n    2,\"22,782\u201323,069\u200c [ JE only ] /23,070\u200c [ BE only ] J: (287 Gtk/14.35 sec) B: (288 Gtk/14.4 sec)\",\"12,931\u201313,218 (287 Gtk/14.35 sec)\",\"22,799\u201323,231 (432 Gtk/21.6 sec)\",\"12,769\u200c [ JE only ] /12,770\u200c [ BE only ] -13,202 J: (433 Gtk/21.65 sec) B: (432 Gtk/21.6 sec)\",\"22,944\u201323,352 (408 Gtk/20.4 sec)\",\"12,648\u201313,057 (409 Gtk/20.45 sec)\"\n\n    3,\"23,070\u200c [ JE only ] /23,071\u200c [ BE only ] -23,296 J: (226 Gtk/11.3 sec) B: (225 Gtk/11.25 sec)\",\"12,705\u201312,930 (225 Gtk/11.25 sec)\",\"23,232\u201323,504 (272 Gtk/13.6 sec)\",\"12,497\u201312,768\u200c [ JE only ] /12,769\u200c [ BE only ] J: (271 Gtk/13.55 sec) B: (272 Gtk/13.6 sec)\",\"23,353\u201323,700 (347 Gtk/17.35 sec)\",\"12,300\u201312,647 (347 Gtk/17.35 sec)\"\n\n    4,\"23,297\u201323,529 (232 Gtk/11.6 sec)\",\"12,471\u201312,704 (233 Gtk/11.65 sec)\",\"23,505\u201323,745 (240 Gtk/12 sec)\",\"12,256\u201312,496 (240 Gtk/12 sec)\",\"23,701-(Dawn/24,000/0)\u201359 (240 Gtk/12 sec)\",\"11,941\u200c [ JE only ] /11,942\u200c [ BE only ] -(Dusk/12,000)-12,299 J: (358 Gtk/17.9 sec) B: (357 Gtk/17.85 sec)\"\n\n    5,\"23,530\u201323,767 (237 Gtk/11.85 sec)\",\"12,233\u201312,470 (237 Gtk/11.85 sec)\",\"23,746\u201323,991 (245 Gtk/12.25 sec)\",\"12,010\u201312,255 (245 Gtk/12.25 sec)\",60\u2013441 (381 Gtk/19.05 sec),\"11,560\u201311,940\u200c [ JE only ] /11,941\u200c [ BE only ] J:(380 Gtk/19 sec) B: (381 Gtk/19.05 sec)\"\n\n    6,\"23,768\u201323,960 (192 Gtk/9.6 sec)\",\"12,041\u201312,232 (191 Gtk/9.55 sec)\",\"23,992\u2013(Dawn/24,000/0)-394 (386 Gtk/19.3 sec)\",\"11,607\u2013(Dusk/12,000)-12,009 (402 Gtk/20.1 sec)\",\"442\u20131,039 (597 Gtk/29.85 sec)\",\"10,962\u201311,559 (597 Gtk/29.85 sec)\"\n\n    7,\"23,961\u2013(Dawn/24,000/0)-166 (127 Gtk/6.35 sec)\",\"11,835\u2013(Dusk/12,000)-12,040 (205 Gtk/10.25 sec)\",395\u2013882 (487 Gtk/24.35 sec),\"11,119\u201311,606 (487 Gtk/24.35 sec)\",\"1,040\u20131,735 (695 Gtk/34.75 sec)\",\"10,266\u201310,961 (695 Gtk/34.75 sec)\"\n\n    8,167\u2013535 (368/18.4 sec),\"11,465\u200c [ JE only ] /11,466\u200c [ BE only ] -11,834 J: (369 Gtk/18.45 sec) B: (368 Gtk/18.4 sec)\",\"883\u20131,429\u200c [ JE only ] /1,430\u200c [ BE only ] J: (546 Gtk/27.3 sec) B: (547 Gtk/27.35 sec)\",\"10,571\u201311,118 (547 Gtk/27.35 sec)\",\"1,736\u20132,608 (872 Gtk/43.6 sec)\",\"9,392\u201310,265 (873 Gtk/43.65 sec)\"\n\n    9,536\u2013933 (397 Gtk/19.85 sec),\"11,067\u201311,464\u200c [ JE only ] /11,465\u200c [ BE only ] J: (397 Gtk/19.85 sec) B: (398 Gtk/19.9 sec)\",\"1,430\u200c [ JE only ] /1,431\u200c [ BE only ] -2,069 J: (639 Gtk/31.95 sec) B: (638 Gtk/31.6 sec)\",\"9,931\u201310,570 (639 Gtk/31.95 sec)\",\"2,609\u20133,942 (1,333 Gtk/1:06.65 sec)\",\"8,059\u20139,391 (1,332 Gtk/1:06.6 sec)\"\n\n    10,\"934\u20131,371 (437 Gtk/21.85 sec)\",\"10,629\u201311,066 (737 Gtk/36.85 sec)\",\"2,070\u20132,875 (805 Gtk/40.25 sec)\",\"9,125\u200c [ JE only ] /9,126\u200c [ BE only ] -9,930 J: (805 Gtk/40.25 sec) B: (804 Gtk/40.2 sec)\",\"3,943\u2013(Noon/6,000)-8,058 (4115 Gtk/3:25)\"\n\n    11,\"1,372\u20131,865 (493 Gtk/24.65 sec)\",\"10,136\u201310,628 (492 Gtk/24.6 sec)\",\"2,876\u20134,108 (1,232 Gtk/1:01.6)\",\"7,892\u20139,124\u200c [ JE only ] /7,893\u20139,125\u200c [ BE only ] J: (1,232 Gtk/1:01.6) B: (1,232 Gtk/1:01.6)\",N/A,N/A\n\n    12,\"1,866\u20132,444 (578 Gtk/28.9 sec)\",\"9,557\u201310,135 (578 Gtk/28.9 sec)\",\"4,109\u2013(Noon/6,000)-7,891\u200c [ JE only ] /7,892\u200c [ BE only ] J:(3,410 Gtk/2:50) B: (3,783 Gtk/3:9.15)\",N/A,N/A\n\n    13,\"2,445\u20133,175 (730 Gtk/36.5 sec)\",\"8,826\u20139,556 (730 Gtk/36.5 sec)\",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A\n\n    14,\"3,176\u20134,294 (1,118 Gtk/55.9 sec)\",\"7,706\u20138,825 (1,119 Gtk/55.95 sec)\",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A\n\n    15,\"4,295\u2013(Noon/6,000)-7,705 (3,410 Gtk/2:50)\",N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A\n\n\n    Using a daylight detector inverts it. However, the output of the inverted detector is not a simple inversion of the daylight detector's output; it uses a much simpler algorithm that depends only on the internal sky light level. Specifically, it outputs a signal strength of 15 minus the current internal sky light level, where values over 15 or below 0 are taken as 15 or 0 respectively. This means that an inverted daylight detector actually outputs a strength of 11 at midnight when it's clear weather, if it has line of sight with the sky. The effects of shade are applied before inverting, so shade increases the signal strength when it isn't already full, and prevents it from reaching zero.\n\n  Fuel\n    Daylight detectors can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per block.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Daylight detectors can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n",

Placement Buttons can be placed by using it on a surface. They can be attached to the side, bottom and top of any full opaque block. If placed on the top or bottom of a block, the button can face any direction.\u200c[Java Edition  only] It can also be attached to the top of a fence in Bedrock Edition. More information about placement on transparent blocks can be found at Opacity/Placement. Activation Buttons are usually in an inactive state, but can be temporarily activated by players. A button can be activated by using it. A wooden button can also be activated by a fired arrow or a thrown trident if its collision box touched the button. Mobs cannot activate buttons directly, but arrows fired by skeletons or dispensers can activate wooden buttons. Behavior When activated, a wooden button remains active for 15 redstone ticks (1.5 seconds, barring lag), while a stone button remains active for 10 redstone ticks (1 second, barring lag). A wooden button activated by a fired arrow or a thrown trident remains active until the arrow or trident despawns (after one minute) or is picked up by a player. While active, a button: When a button changes state it provides a redstone update to all redstone components adjacent to itself (including above and below), and to all redstone components adjacent to its attachment block.\n\n  Fuel\n    Wooden buttons can be used as a fuel source in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per button.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    Pointed dripstone is a block that makes up stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites (which point downward) can be used as falling projectiles, to renewably drip water and lava into cauldrons and to convert mud into clay. Stalagmites (which point upward) deal extra damage to players and mobs that land on them.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Pointed dripstone can be mined with any tool,[1] but pickaxes are the quickest. Pointed dripstone breaks instantly when hit by a thrown trident.\n\n    Block,Pointed Dripstone\n\n    Hardness,1.5\n\n    Tool,Pickaxe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,2.25\n\n    Wooden,1.15\n\n    Stone,0.6\n\n    Iron,0.4\n\n    Diamond,0.3\n\n    Netherite,0.25\n\n    Golden,0.2\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Pointed dripstone can be found in dripstone caves in cluster formations.\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders can sell 2 pointed dripstone for 1 emerald.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Pointed dripstone will grow only if it is hanging directly under a dripstone block while there is a water source above. In addition, if there is a solid block less than eleven blocks below this stalactite, a stalagmite grows on that block toward the stalactite. This growth does not occur if the stalactite's tip is waterlogged, and a stalagmite below does not grow if its tip is waterlogged. They do not grow to more than seven blocks long. Every time the block receives a random tick there is a small chance of 1.138% (64\u20445625) for a stalactite or stalagmite to grow one block, meaning that every single growth step takes an average time of 5 in-game days (100 minutes).\n\nUsage\n    Pointed dripstone comes in two different forms, stalactites and stalagmites. Placing a pointed dripstone between a stalagmite and stalactite without sneaking connects them. It can be waterlogged. Mobs can jump up pointed dripstone as long as its height does not exceed four blocks. Horses and other similar mobs can travel up the same pointed dripstone as if they were stairs.\n\n  Stalactites\n    Stalactites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the bottom of a block. Stalactites less than 11 blocks tall passively drip water particles (or lava particles in the Nether) in the absence of a liquid source, but these particles do not fill cauldrons. A waterlogged pointed dripstone at the tip of a stalactite does not produce drip particles. Waterlogging other parts of the stalactite does not affect the dripping. If the block supporting a stalactite or any block of the stalactite is broken, all of the unsupported pointed dripstone below the broken block drops, causing damage to any player and mobs standing beneath it, similar to a falling anvil. The amount of damage is 6 for each block of falling distance after 2 blocks (e.g., a stalactite that falls 4 blocks deals 18 \u00d7 9 damage). The damage is capped at 40 \u00d7 20, no matter how far the stalactite falls. Wearing a helmet reduces the damage by 1\u20444, but this costs twice as much durability on the helmet as on other armor pieces. When a player dies by a stalactite falling on them, the death message \"<player> was skewered by a falling stalactite\" appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling stalactite entity, no damage is dealt unless the stalactite hits the ground in the same block where the player is located. Stalactites with multiple pointed dripstone can cause multiple damage; however, damage immunity prevents most of the damage from additional blocks. When the uppermost block of a stalactite less than 11 blocks tall gets randomly ticked, it checks for a water source or waterlogged block two blocks above it and a cauldron within 10 blocks under the tip with no non-air blocks in between. If both conditions are satisfied, there is a 45\u2044256 (~17.6%) chance for it to drip water and fill the cauldron by one level. If there is a lava source above the stalactite, there is a 15\u2044256 (~5.9%) chance for it to completely fill an empty cauldron with lava instead, making lava a renewable resource. Refilling a cauldron with water or lava averages nearly one Minecraft day (19+ minutes) although the actual time for any individual refill varies. If mud\u200c is placed above a block with a stalactite underneath, it eventually turns into clay. This conversion does not happen in the Nether.[2]\n\n  Stalagmites\n    Stalagmites are created when pointed dripstone is placed on the ground. Falling onto stalagmites multiplies the fall distance by two to calculate the total amount of fall damage, using the formula ceil(fall_distance \u00d7 2 \u2212 2). Note that the distance traveled during the last game tick of falling time is not included in this calculation, making it slightly off at higher distances; see Damage \u00a7 Fall damage for more information. If a player dies from falling onto a stalagmite, the death message \"<player> was impaled on a stalagmite\" appears. All mobs that are immune to fall damage do not take damage from falling into stalagmites, the same applies to the player if the game rule fallDamage is set to false.[3][4]\n\n  Columns\n    Dripstone columns can be found naturally in dripstone caves, they are formed when stalactites and stalagmites join together in mid-air. To create them manually, simply keep stacking pointed dripstones on either the stalactite or the stalagmite or both until they join together, the last pointed dripstone placed being the most slender part of the whole column. Based on the direction of the last block placed, the shape of the column's slender part can vary.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Dripstone Block,Pointed Dripstone,\"[[None, None, None], ['', '', None], ['', '', None]]\"\n\n\n",

Blooming sculk can replace blocks in the sculk_replaceable tag, which includes the surface materials of most of the biomes in all three dimensions. If a mob is killed and detected by the sculk catalyst while over a sculk block, it may occasionally result in the growth of a sculk sensor or sculk shrieker. If a mob dies near multiple sculk catalysts, this does not increase the number of sculk-related blocks generated. The means of death of the mob is irrelevant; mobs can die from being killed by a player, by another mob, or from environmental damage. Rather than granting experience, a bubbling charge spawns where the mob died, and it travels through sculk until it finds a replaceable block. The strength of the sculk spreading depends on the amount of experience the mob would have dropped when it was killed by a player or a tamed wolf. Several sculk charges may end up on the same block and merge, up to 1000 charges per block. Sculk catalysts can replace the following blocks with sculk: In Java Edition, these blocks are marked under the sculk_replacable tag. If a mob dies and a charge is detected more than 4 blocks from a catalyst, a sculk block has a chance to use 10 experience to grow a sculk sensor or a sculk shrieker. A sculk sensor has a 9% chance to spawn and a sculk shrieker has a 1% chance to spawn. However, sculk sensors and sculk shriekers cannot spawn if there are 2 or more sensors within a 9\u00d73\u00d79 box with the bottom center of the box centered on the bubbling charge location (or within -4,0,-4 and 4,2,4 in relative coordinates). A player dying can also affect the sculk catalyst, depending on how much experience the player has gathered. The sculk catalyst spreads a number of sculk blocks depending on player experience, with no spreading if a player dies with zero experience. A sculk catalyst does not respond to the death of mobs that do not yield any experience, such as baby animals. It also does not respond to the ender dragon's death,[1] although this may be implemented in the future.[2]\n\n  Light source\n    Sculk catalysts emit a light level of 6.\n\n",

Placement To place a pressure plate, use it while aiming at the face of a block adjacent to the destination space. A pressure plate can be attached to: A pressure plate cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the plate to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach a plate to the side of the fence causes the plate to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead. More information regarding placement on transparent blocks can be found at Opacity/Placement. Activation A pressure plate activates when an entity is on top of it (specifically, when the entity's collision mask intersects the bottom quarter-block of the pressure plate's space, which may include entities flying close to the ground), with a minimum activation time of 1 second. A stone pressure plate is activated only by mobs, players and armor stands, while a wooden pressure plate or a weighted pressure plate is activated by all entities (including players, mobs, items, arrows, experience orbs, fishing bobs, etc.) besides snowballs. Once activated, a pressure plate checks if entities are still present at regular intervals. Heavy or light weighted pressure plates check every 5 redstone ticks, starting 5 redstone ticks after activation, so they deactivate up to 5 redstone ticks (10 game ticks or 0.5 seconds, barring lag) after no entities are on top of them. Stone or wooden pressure plates check every 10 redstone ticks, starting 10 redstone ticks after activation, so they deactivate up to 10 redstone ticks (20 game ticks or 1 second, barring lag) after no entities are on top of them. A minecart traveling on rails activates a pressure plate next to a diagonal track but not one next to a straight track (stone pressure plates are activated only if the minecart contains a mob or player).

For weighted pressure plates, the power level varies depending on the number of entities. The signal strength from a weighted pressure plate does not vary with the type of entity: all entities have the same \"weight\", so two mobs produce the same strength as two dropped items. An item stack counts as a single entity, no matter how many items are in the stack. When multiple items of the same type fall on a weighted pressure plate, they may initially be separate item entities and the weighted pressure plate counts them separately, but if they then collapse into a single item stack entity the signal strength from the weighted pressure plate may go down. Water and lava flows around a pressure plate without affecting it. A pressure plate is not solid (it is not a barrier to entity movement). A block under a pressure plate can provide a solid barrier underneath it (for mobs to walk across, items to fall on, etc.), but when a pressure plate is placed on a block with a small collision mask, such as a fence or nether brick fence, it is possible for entities to move through the pressure plate while still activating it (walking through it horizontally, or falling through it vertically). Thus, a pressure plate on a fence can be used to detect entities without stopping them (more compactly than a tripwire circuit). Pressure plates are 0.0625 blocks high (1\u204416 of a block) when inactive and 0.03125 blocks high (1\u204432 of a block) when active, but because they are not solid they do not affect the position of entities \"on top\" of them, so a player on top of a pressure plate is actually standing on the block beneath it. Pressure plates can also open doors, activate TNT, and power command blocks.\n\n  Fuel\n    Wooden pressure plates can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per pressure plate.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Wooden pressure plates can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds. Stone pressure plates can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

Fortune I increases the chance for this drop to 14.29% (1\u20447), Fortune II increases it to 25%, and Fortune III guarantees the gold nugget drop.\n\n    Block,Gilded Blackstone\n\n    Hardness,1.5\n\n    Tool,wooden pickaxe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,7.5\n\n    Wooden,1.15\n\n    Stone,0.6\n\n    Iron,0.4\n\n    Diamond,0.3\n\n    Netherite,0.25\n\n    Golden,0.2\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Gilded blackstone generates as part of bastion remnants, replacing some of the blackstone in the structure; they can also be found beneath bastion chests.\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Gilded Blackstone,Bastion remnant,Hoglin\u00a0stable\u00a0chest,2\u20135,\"22.8% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"2\u20135\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.22793887963348602, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Hoglin stable chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Treasure\u00a0chest,5\u201315,\"33.7% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"5\u201315\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.33668648071940255, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Treasure chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Generic\u00a0chest,1\u20135,\"44.1% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20135\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.44077588319736705, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Generic chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bridge\u00a0chest,8\u201312,\"11.2% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"8\u201312\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.11242603550295849, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Bridge chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bedrock Edition\n\n    Gilded Blackstone,Bastion remnant,Hoglin\u00a0stable\u00a0chest,2\u20135,\"22.8% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"2\u20135\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.22793887963348602, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Hoglin stable chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Treasure\u00a0chest,5\u201315,\"33.7% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"5\u201315\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.33668648071940255, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Treasure chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Generic\u00a0chest,1\u20135,\"44.1% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20135\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.44077588319736705, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Generic chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bridge\u00a0chest,8\u201312,\"11.2% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Gilded Blackstone\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"8\u201312\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.11242603550295849, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Bridge chest\"\" }\"\n\n\nUsage\n    Gilded blackstone is primarily used for decoration.\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins are attracted to gilded blackstone and run toward any gilded blackstone on the ground, and inspect it for 6 to 8 seconds before putting it in their inventory.

Blast furnaces serve as the counterpart to smokers, which are used mainly to cook food faster. Smelting equipment yields one iron or gold nugget from their respective materials. Once an item and a fuel are placed into the blast furnace, the block state changes to lit and the item is smelted twice as fast as a regular furnace. Fuel is also used at double the rate of regular furnaces, so the number of items smelted per fuel stays the same. The product can then be collected by using the output. Like normal furnaces, a hopper can be used to feed items into a blast furnace and can also pick up items from it.\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village has a blast furnace that has not been claimed by a villager, any nearby villager who has not chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to armorer.\n\n  Light source\n    Blast furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, similar to normal furnaces.\n\n  Custom name\n    By default, the interface of a blast furnace is labeled \"Blast Furnace\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Lock\n    In Java Edition, a blast furnace can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a blast furnace's Lock tag is not blank, the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a blast furnace at (0,64,0) so that the blast furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Blast Furnace Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Blast Furnace Key\"}.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Blast furnace can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

If it is renamed on an anvil , it also retains its name.\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Storage\n    A shulker box has 27 inventory slots, the same as a chest. Shulker boxes are portable chests: they keep their items when broken, which can be retrieved when placed again. This is different from other containers, which drop their contained items as item entities when broken. A shulker box drops itself as an item if pushed by pistons or destroyed by an explosion. Unlike most blocks with inventory, shulker boxes always drop themselves when destroyed by explosions. When a shulker box with items inside is being held\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] or is in a container's inventory, the items are listed on the tooltip as properties. A shulker box's items can be fed or removed by a hopper. Shulker boxes can be stored in all containers except for other shulker boxes and bundles. When placed on a wall or ceiling, shulker boxes face and open sideways or upside-down, respectively. Shulker boxes cannot be opened if a solid opaque block is on their top surface, similar to a chest. For example, if a shulker box is facing upside-down and a solid opaque block is below it, the shulker box cannot be opened. A shulker box can also be placed using dispensers. Like a chest, a shulker box requires a transparent area above to be opened, and it opens only if the hitbox of the top of the open shulker box does not intersect with another hitbox. This way, a shulker box can be opened with an upside-down slab or an upper trapdoor on top of it. It is also unique in that when opened, its hitbox expands to 1.5 blocks high/wide, physically pushing entities where it is facing. By default, the GUI of a shulker box is labeled \"Shulker Box\", which can be changed by naming it in an anvil or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command.\u200c[Java Edition  only] When a shulker box item is destroyed, the contents of the shulker box are dropped as items.\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins become hostile toward players who open or mine shulker boxes.[1]\n\n  Undyeing\n    Dyed shulker boxes can be undyed using a cauldron. To do this, use a dyed shulker box on a cauldron that has water in it. This causes the cauldron's water level to decrease by 1, and the dyed shulker box loses its dye color.\n\n",

Enchanting tables draw power from bookshelves placed around them, improving applied enchantments at the expense of level requirement.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    In Java Edition, an enchanting table requires a\u00a0pickaxe\u00a0to be mined, in which case it drops itself.

Upon placing the item, three (pseudo)randomized options appear on the right of the GUI. The glyphs here do not affect the enchantment, but hovering over a presented enchantment shows one enchantment to be applied (on mobile devices, the player can tap an enchantment before putting in the Lapis Lazuli or hold the enchantment before release). The only choices available have a level requirement equal to or below the player's current level and a Lapis Lazuli requirement equal to or below the number of lapis lazuli placed in the table. Each option imbues the item with a randomized set of enchantments that are dependent on the number of experience levels required (e.g. a level 10 enchantment can give a pickaxe the \"Efficiency II\" enchantment); the actual level cost and the number of Lapis Lazuli required have no effect. Although the player must have at least the level requirement to get an enchantment, the number of levels that the player is charged is the same as the Lapis Lazuli requirement. For example, if the third enchantment listed is a level 30-50 enchantment, the player must have at least 30 levels, while paying only 3 levels and 3 Lapis Lazuli. The level requirement influences the quantity, type, and level of enchantments instilled in the item, with a higher experience level generally resulting in more and/or higher-level enchantments. Nevertheless, there is a significant random factor, and even a level 30 enchantment (the maximum) doesn't guarantee more than one enchantment, or even that enchantments are \"maximum strength\" \u2014 a level 30 enchantment can still yield Fortune II or Efficiency III alone, for example. To increase the enchantment level, bookshelves should be placed next to the enchanting table while keeping one block of air, or a replaceable block such as grass, between them. Most types of blocks being between the enchantment table and the bookshelves - even transparent blocks like torches - prevents the table from connecting with the shelves. To gain access to the previously mentioned level 30 enchantments, a total of 15 bookshelves need to be placed around the enchanting table. See the enchantment mechanics page for more detailed information on this. The enchanting table is 3\u20444 blocks high. Despite comprising largely of obsidian, they are not immune to destruction by the ender dragon.[1]\n\n  Enchanting\n    The enchanting table's main purpose is to enchant items. The table can enchant only the following items: Many other items can instead be enchanted using an anvil and an appropriate enchanted book. When a bookshelf is placed next to an enchanting table (with one block of air in between) it increases the maximum enchantment level. There must be 15 bookshelves around the enchanting table in order to obtain the maximum enchantment level of 30. See enchantment mechanics for more specific details.\n\n  Light source\n    Enchanting tables emit a light level of 7.\n\n  Standard Galactic Alphabet\n    The arcane glyphs that float from bookshelves to the enchanting table and the cryptic runes in the enchanting table's interface are written in the Standard Galactic Alphabet, which is a simple alphabet substitution cipher used in the Commander Keen series of computer games.  The arcane glyphs cannot be seen if \"particles\" in the video settings is set to \"minimal\". The cryptic runes seen in the interface are randomly constructed from the following list of words: The Java Edition additionally may use the following words:\u200c[JE  only] Three to five words are chosen from the list and appended to each other, then displayed in the Standard Galactic Alphabet. Although sometimes the words chosen accidentally refer to mobs like Blazes and Elder Guardians, the words chosen are random and purely cosmetic; they have no relation to the enchantments to be applied to the item and are not saved on the enchanted item (meaning they say nothing about the spell's identity), and they are displayed only in the enchanting table. Only the cost and one of the enchantments are known.\n\n  Custom name\n    By default, the GUI of an enchanting table is labeled \"Enchant\", but this name can be customized by naming the enchanting table in an anvil before placing it or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command\u200c[Java Edition  only].\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Enchanting tables can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Enchanting tables cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by sticky pistons.\n\n",

It allows skipping steps to craft certain blocks; for example, a stone block can be directly turned into chiseled stone bricks, but requires multiple steps with crafting. Stonecutting is also more efficient than crafting for certain recipes. Crafting stairs is more efficient with a stonecutter than a crafting table, as 6 full blocks are crafted into 4 stairs, while stonecutter yields 1 stair per full block. The recipe for cut copper is even more efficient: with stonecutting, 1 block of copper turns into 4 blocks of cut copper, allowing the amount of copper blocks to be quadrupled. The GUI contains a block selection menu that is empty. The menu is populated with blocks that can be crafted from that particular material, only if a block is inserted into its input.\n\n    Name,Ingredients,Cutting recipe,Description\n\n    Stone Stairs

                    "context": "Overview\n    Ice is a translucent solid block. It can slide entities using all methods of transportation (excluding minecarts).\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Ice can be easily destroyed without tools, but the use of a pickaxe speeds up the process. It can be broken instantly with Efficiency III on a diamond pickaxe. However, the block drops only when using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. If mined without Silk Touch, the block drops nothing, and instead is replaced with water if there is a block under the ice block.\n\n    Block,Ice\n\n    Hardness,0.5\n\n    Tool,Pickaxe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.75\n\n    Wooden,0.4\n\n    Stone,0.2\n\n    Iron,0.15\n\n    Diamond,0.1\n\n    Netherite,0.1\n\n    Golden,0.1\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Ice can be found naturally as part of the landscape in snowy biomes from rivers, and oceans. It can also be found in igloos\u200c[Java Edition  only], ice spikes, icebergs, snowy slopes, also on landscape of frozen peaks biomes. They also generate in ancient cities.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Water source blocks in a snowy biome eventually freeze into ice if exposed to the sky from directly above, the light level inside the water block is less than 10, and there is at least one horizontally adjacent non-water (and non-waterlogged) block. This can happen at any time of day, and in any weather condition. Water also freezes into ice in cold biomes, as long as the altitude is high enough for snowfall. Ice formation occurs as part of chunk ticking, so it requires that a player is nearby similar to crop growth or grass spreading. The speed of ice formation is affected by the game rule randomTickSpeed. When an ice bomb is thrown into water, it transforms the water in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube centered around the projectile into ice. This works for source water or flowing water upon hit.\n\nUsage\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Packed Ice,Ice,\"[['', '', ''], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n\n    Despite being created by a 3\u00d73 recipe, packed ice is not a storage block, because it cannot be crafted back into ice. The same applies to the next tier of compression, blue ice.\n\n  Speed\n    Ice is slightly slippery, causing entities (excluding minecarts[1]) to slide, including items. This allows for increased speed of items in water currents, by placing ice blocks under the water current. Items already travel at high speeds in water currents because they float, so ice block water streams are less necessary for item transportation. A player who sprints and jumps repeatedly on ice travels faster than on any other block type. The player can travel even faster if they sprint and spam jump in a 2-block-high corridor with ice on the floor, allowing the player to accelerate to extremely high speeds, although this will cost them a lot of hunger. In Java Edition, when a non-full block is placed on top of ice, the block has the same \"slipperiness\" as the ice below it.[2] Like other entities, boats travel extremely quickly on ice/blue ice, where it can reach a speed of 40-72 m/s, much faster than the 8 m/s speed on water.[3] More beneficially, unlike water, ice can be placed in the Nether, allowing players to construct boat highways made of ice/blue ice in the dimension, to make use of the 1:8 distance travel ratio, and travel at an equivalent speed up to 320-580 m/s (720-1300 mph) between locations in the Overworld.\n\n  Creating water\n    Ice can be used to create water either by its melting or being broken. If there is a non-air block directly underneath the ice block, the ice becomes a water source block when broken. Ice also melts into water if the block light level immediately next to it on any side is higher than 11. Sky light level is ignored, therefore ice does not melt from sunlight. In  Minecraft Education and Bedrock Edition, ice also melts when near a heat block, though heat blocks do not produce light. Compared to water buckets, ice has the benefit of being able to stack in the inventory. Therefore, carrying ice instead of water buckets can be much more convenient, if the player wants to create a lot of water sources. If ice melts or is broken in the Nether, no water is produced (it sublimates).\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    Farmland is a block created by using a hoe on most types of dirt, and cannot be obtained in the inventory in Survival mode. It is required to grow all types of seeds, as well as carrots and potatoes. Hydrated farmland is farmland that becomes soaked with water from a water block (flowing is ok) within 4 blocks horizontally and on the same level or 1 block above the farmland block.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    When mined (even with a Silk Touch tool), farmland drops dirt. In Java Edition, it can be obtained from the inventory only by using commands, or by the Creative inventory or the pick block control.\n\n    Block,Farmland\n\n    Hardness,0.6\n\n    Tool,Shovel\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.9\n\n    Wooden,0.45\n\n    Stone,0.25\n\n    Iron,0.15\n\n    Diamond,0.15\n\n    Netherite,0.1\n\n    Golden,0.1\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Farmland occurs naturally in villages where wheat, potatoes, carrots, beetroots, pumpkin stem, and melon stem are grown. Patches of farmland are surrounded by logs or sandstone, spruce trapdoor, and cobblestone. They also naturally occur in woodland mansions.\n\n  Post-generation\n    A player may create a block of farmland by using a hoe on a dirt block, grass block, or dirt path.\n\nUsage\n    Farmland is required to grow eight of the game's types of crops. Those are wheat seeds, carrots, potatoes, beetroot seeds, melon seeds, pumpkin seeds, torchflower seeds, and pitcher pods. Plants such as saplings[1], ferns, grass, and flowers[2] may be planted on farmland. Mushrooms[3], sugar cane[4], bamboo[5], dead bushes[6], twisting vines[7] and cacti cannot be planted on farmland. Ladders and torches cannot be attached to the side of a farmland block. Farmland is a partial block (15/16th of a block in height) and so mobs cannot spawn on it.\n\n  Hydration\n    A farmland block is created dry, and eventually reverts back to dirt if not hydrated and nothing is planted on it. For farmland to become hydrated, water must be present: The blocks between the farmland block and the water make no difference. Flowing or still water also makes no difference. The rate at which farmland becomes hydrated cannot be changed. Each farmland block within a 9\u00d79 grid of farmland with a single water block in the middle has exactly the same chance of becoming hydrated as a single farmland block in an ocean. Farmland can also be hydrated by rain. Different types of seeds grow faster on hydrated farmland than on dry farmland. Hydrated farmland yields a fully developed wheat crop in a little over a single day/night cycle.\n\n  Decay\n    Farmland eventually decays into normal dirt if is dehydrated and nothing is planted in it. Additionally, a farmland block becomes a dirt block, regardless of its state of hydration, if any of the following occur: When farmland decays, any crops growing on the block are dropped as items, as if they were harvested. A ravager does not turn farmland to dirt when stepping on it, but it does destroy all crops.\n\n",

            "paragraphs": [
                {
                    "context": "Overview\n    Lava is a light-emitting fluid that causes fire damage, mostly found in the lower reaches of the Overworld and the Nether.\n\nObtaining\n    Lava can be collected by using a bucket on a lava source block or a full lava cauldron, creating a lava bucket. Lava may be obtained renewably from cauldrons, as pointed dripstone with a lava source above it can slowly fill a cauldron with lava. In Java Edition, lava does not have a direct item form, but in Bedrock Edition it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing or add-ons.\n\n  Natural generation\n    During world generation, lava replaces air blocks generated in caves and canyons between Y=-55 and Y=-63. Aquifers are sometimes filled with lava below Y=0. Lava does not replace air blocks inside mineshafts, monster rooms, amethyst geodes, or strongholds. Lava can also occur as lava flows from a single spring block, pouring down walls into pools. The spring block can be on the side of a cave, ravine, mineshaft, or stone cliff above ground. Lava also generates as small lava lakes, which can be found above Y=0 within any biome. Two blocks of lava can also be found in plains, snowy plains, and desert village weaponsmith buildings, or one source in savanna village weaponsmith buildings. Fifteen blocks of lava can be found in the end portal room of a stronghold: 3 along each side wall, and 9 below the portal frame. Lava also generates in woodland mansions: two blocks of lava generate in the \"blacksmith room\", and 25 blocks of lava generate in a secret \"lava room\". In the Nether, lava is more common than water in the Overworld. Seas of lava occur, with sea level at y-level 32, about a quarter of the total height of the Nether (as the usable space in the Nether is 128 blocks tall). They can extend down to about y-level 19-22. Lava also randomly appears in single blocks inside netherrack formations. Lava is also generated as a single source in well rooms in nether fortresses. There are also large pockets of lava generated under y-19 and can reach all the way down to bedrock level. These pockets are generally over 12 blocks in height and often connect to a large lava lake on y-32; the size of these pockets in 1.18 can range from the size of a singular pre-1.18 ravine to multiple ravines combined. Lava generates as delta shapes, which can be found commonly in the basalt deltas biome. Lava also generates in ruined portals and bastion remnants.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Unlike water source blocks, new lava source blocks cannot be created in a space by two or more adjacent source blocks. However in Java Edition, if the game rule lavaSourceConversion is set to true, new lava source blocks can form in a similar way to water source blocks.\n\nUsage\n  Fuel\n    When used in a furnace, a bucket of lava lasts 1000 seconds (100 items).\n\n  Burning\n    Most entities take 4 damage every half-second while in contact with lava, and are set on fire. An entity/player in lava also has its remainingFireTicks set to 300, setting it on fire for 15 seconds. This timer is reset to 300 every tick that the victim spends in lava, so it starts counting down once the victim leaves the lava. Once the victim does exit the lava source, it burns for just under 15 seconds, taking fire damage 14 times. This is due to the fact that for the first tick outside of lava, its remainingFireTicks decrease to 299, and entities take fire damage when remainingFireTicks is a multiple of 20 and greater than 0. If the victim touches water or rain falls on it, the fire is extinguished, but the lava continues to damage them directly. In addition, a dense fog effect is applied for players under lava to obscure vision. This can be slightly mitigated via the Fire Resistance effect. An entity/player moving in lava has their horizontal movement speed reduced by 50% and their vertical movement speed reduced by 20%. In Bedrock Edition, a player with the Fire Resistance effect or a total Fire Protection of 7 or higher does not catch fire. Vexes, zoglins, Nether mobs (excluding piglins and hoglins), withers, wardens, and players or mobs affected by the Fire Resistance effect are not damaged when touching lava. The embers or fireballs that fly out of lava are purely decorative and do not cause fires or damage to entities. When rain falls on lava, the black ember particles appear more frequently. A player in lava lasts a few seconds before dying: If the player is wearing armor enchanted with Fire Protection, they can last even longer. With the maximum bonus, the damage is small enough that the natural healing from a full hunger bar can outpace it \u200c[JE  only], so a player could survive indefinitely as long as they have food and their armor holds up (non-netherite armor is damaged by lava). This maximum bonus can be obtained by wearing 2 pieces of armor with Fire Protection IV and 1 with Protection IV, or 1 piece of armor with Fire Protection IV and 3 with Protection IV. Lava can cause fires by turning air blocks to fire blocks. In order for air above lava to turn to fire, a block adjacent to the air has to be flammable, or one of the wood-constructed non-flammable blocks. Since catching fire depends on air blocks, even torches or lava itself can prevent a flammable block from catching fire.  Additionally, not all flammable or wood-constructed blocks can be ignited by lava. The lava of any depth can start fires this way, whether or not it appears to have a current. Additional conditions must be met, depending on the edition of Minecraft. Air block must be in a 3\u00d71\u00d73 area right above the lava or in a 5\u00d71\u00d75 2 blocks above the lava. An air block in the 5\u00d71\u00d75 area does not catch on fire if the 3\u00d71\u00d73 area is completely filled, even if the latter is filled with flammable blocks. The block to be set on fire must be in a 3\u00d73\u00d73 cube centered on a lava block, above which there must be either air or an ignitable block.\n\n  Flow\n    Lava flows from \"source blocks\". Most streams or \"lava-falls\" come from a single source block, but lava lakes (including the \"flood lava\" in the bottom 10 layers) are composed entirely of source blocks. A source block can be captured only with a bucket. In the Overworld and the End, lava travels 3 blocks in any horizontal direction from a source block. Lava flows far more slowly than water (1 block every 30 game ticks, or 1.5 seconds), and sourceless lava flows linger for a short time more. In the Nether, lava travels 7 blocks horizontally and spreads 1 block every 10 game ticks, or 2 blocks per second, which is half the speed as water in the Overworld. In all dimensions, lava spreading uses the same mechanic as water: for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. (This can result in lava flows turning toward dropoffs that they cannot reach in the Overworld and the End.) Flowing lava destroys the following in its path: saplings, cobweb, tall grass, dead bush, wheat, flowers, mushrooms, snow on ground (but snow blocks are immune), lily pads, vines, levers, buttons, all three types of torches, redstone, repeaters, end rods, and rails. Sugar canes hold back lava, but disappear if the sugar cane's water source is destroyed by the lava. Lava also slows down entities, including those that are normally immune to lava damage. Using redstone wire, a one-block lava flow can be redirected by supplying power to the source block, which causes it to reset the flow toward the now-nearest terrain depression. It cannot, however, be reversed. This re-calculation is made because of the redstone wire when toggled changes the block from redstone (on) to redstone (off). Whenever a block updates on any side of the lava, the lava re-calculates where to flow, but does not cut off its current direction of flow. In Bedrock Edition using the /setblock command can be used to create stationary lava without the use of barriers. Flowing lava can push entities.\n\n    ,,,4,,,\n\n    ,,4,3,4,,\n\n    ,4,3,2,3,4,\n\n    4,3,2,1,2,3,4\n\n    ,4,3,2,3,4,\n\n    ,,4,3,4,,\n\n    ,,,4,,,\n\n\n    Range,Height in blocks\n\n    1,block,1\n\n    2,blocks,0.75-1\n\n    3,blocks,0.5-0.75\n\n    4,blocks,0.25-0.5\n\n\n    ,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,,8,7,8,,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,8,7,6,7,8,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,8,7,6,5,6,7,8,,,,\n\n    ,,,8,7,6,5,4,5,6,7,8,,,\n\n    ,,8,7,6,5,4,3,4,5,6,7,8,,\n\n    ,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,\n\n    8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n\n    ,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,\n\n    ,,8,7,6,5,4,3,4,5,6,7,8,,\n\n    ,,,8,7,6,5,4,5,6,7,8,,,\n\n    ,,,,8,7,6,5,6,7,8,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,8,7,6,7,8,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,,8,7,8,,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,,,8,,,,,,,\n\n\n    Range,Height in blocks\n\n    1,block,1\n\n    2,blocks,0.75-1\n\n    3,blocks,0.625-0.75\n\n    4,blocks,0.5-0.625\n\n    5,blocks,0.375-0.5\n\n    6,blocks,0.25-0.375\n\n    7,blocks,0.125-0.25\n\n\n  Lava and water\n    Water and lava can produce stone, cobblestone, or obsidian based on how they interact.

These droplets do not do anything other than warn the player that a deluge of lava lies above that block. The particles function identically to their water counterparts, except that they drip slower. Flowing lava can set off tripwires because it breaks placed string. Lava triggers a tripwire only once. Any item dropped into lava is immediately destroyed, except for netherite-related items. Lodestones, however, can be destroyed by lava despite containing netherite.[1] Lava can be placed in an empty cauldron. If lava is above a non-transparent block supporting pointed dripstone, dripping particles are created on the end. These can fill cauldrons with lava.\n\nFarming\n    Lava farms can be created by placing a lava source block on top of a solid block and a pointed dripstone and a cauldron underneath.\n\n",

This yields one glow berry when the vine is bearing them and nothing when it is not.  A cave vine also breaks if water runs over its location or if a piston extends or pushes a block into its location. In Bedrock Edition, using a tool with Silk Touch on cave vines always yields a glow berry, even if the vine appears empty. Fortune has no effect on the number of glow berries dropped.\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Glow berries can be placed on and grown from the bottom of most blocks. They have no specific lighting requirements. When placed, they can be of any length.\n\n  Growth\n    Placing glow berries on the bottom of a block creates a cave vine that grows downward one block at a time as long as air is beneath it and its maximum height (2 to 26 blocks) has not been reached. Each newly-grown cave vine block has a 1 in 9 chance of bearing glow berries.  Only this tip can ever naturally grow them.\u200c[Java Edition  only][more information needed] Using bone meal on a cave vine produces glow berries if the vine was not bearing any. In Java Edition, cave vines stop growing if shears are used on the tip. In Bedrock Edition, if placing glow berries in the Nether, cave vines are able to grow and produces glow berries.\n\n  Food\n    To eat glow berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4 hunger saturation points, like sweet berries.\n\n  Light\n    When bearing glow berries, cave vines give off a light level of 14.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing glow berries into a composter by using them on it has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Breeding\n    Glow berries can be fed to foxes to breed them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds glow berries. The resulting baby fox trusts the player and does not flee. Glow berries can be used on baby foxes to reduce the time until they grow by 10%.\n\n",

The collision box is identical to the shape of the pane. Therefore, two glass panes placed with one empty space in between forms a gap that is two blocks wide. Stained glass panes are never oriented horizontally. Horizontal stained glass surfaces must be made from stained glass blocks.

They are mainly found in villages as a path for the villagers.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    A shovel is the most efficient tool for mining dirt paths. A dirt path has the highest hardness value of all blocks mineable with a shovel. In Bedrock Edition, a dirt path block can be directly obtained with a Silk Touch tool.[1] In Java Edition, dirt paths always drop dirt when broken. Dirt path blocks can be obtained only via the Creative inventory, commands, or pick block.

Most dirt paths connect to village structures and houses. Dirt paths also generate as part of some village structures. Although they can't be placed that way by the player, village generation can cause them to appear under other blocks.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Dirt paths can be created by using any type of shovel on the side or top of dirt, grass block, coarse dirt, mycelium, podzol, or rooted dirt that has air above it. The shovel then loses one durability.\n\nUsage\n    Dirt paths are primarily used for decoration, although they also prevent hostile mobs from spawning. They are a similar color to grass blocks placed in a desert or savanna biome. They are only 15\u204416 of a block high, therefore items that require a full block like torches and buttons cannot be placed on them. Villagers and iron golems prefer to use dirt paths the most when routing compared to any other block.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] A dirt path block converts to dirt instantly if a block with a solid material is placed on top of it. Using a hoe on dirt path converts it to farmland. Since dirt path can be created with any variant of dirt, it can be used as an intermediate step to convert podzol and mycelium, which cannot be tilled directly, into farmland.\n\n",

In addition, azaleas and mangrove propagules can also grow trees. Saplings have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees. When a tree is to be grown, a height is chosen and then the ground and space above are checked; if the ground is bad or there is not space for the chosen height, the tree does not grow. Bone meal can be used to speed up the growth of the sapling, even to grow the tree without sufficient light. Saplings can grow into trees when placed on all variants of dirt (except dirt paths) or moss blocks. The sapling requires a light level of at least 9, and require a certain volume of space above the sapling, based on its type: In addition: Dirt blocks in the space above the sapling are an exception. Dirt blocks do not stop the sapling from growing. For most tree types, including giant versions, the dirt remains in place and the rest of the tree generates normally around it (it is possible to grow a tree that contains only one log block at the original sapling location, with a column of dirt above where the rest of the trunk should be and leaves spreading out from it). For the large variant of oak trees, the dirt blocks are replaced with log blocks wherever they would normally occur. In Java Edition, all types of log block and wood block and their stripped versions are also treated like dirt blocks (they don't stop growth). In Bedrock Edition, log and wood blocks are treated like other block types and stop the sapling from growing if they are above it. When a sapling on a grass block grows into a tree, the grass block becomes a dirt block.\n\n  Bee nests\n    Oak and birch trees grown from saplings that are within 2 blocks of any flower, flowering azalea,\u200c[JE  only] or flowering azalea leaves\u200c[JE  only] have a 5% chance to grow with a bee nest and 1-3 bees in it.\n\n  Decoration\n    Any kind of sapling can be placed in a flower pot.\n\n  Fuel\n    Saplings can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per sapling.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a sapling into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of saplings yields an average of 2.74 bonemeal.\n\n",

A player sleeps by using a bed during a thunderstorm, or at night (between 12542 and 23459 ticks in clear weather, when stars appear in the sky, or between 12010 and 23991 ticks in rainy weather). Players can sleep during a thunderstorm even if they are in a biome where it does not rain (i.e. Desert). Attempting to use a bed at any other time results in the message \"You can sleep only at night or during thunderstorms\"\u200c[JE  only] or \"You can only sleep at night\".\u200c[BE  only] A player sleeps in a bed for 101 in-game ticks, or 5.05 seconds before the time skips to the next day. Sleeping in a bed with the /gamerule doDaylightCycle set to false results in the player being kicked out of the bed after the 101 ticks, but does not change time of the world to day. Sleeping in a bed is possible only in the Overworld. Attempting to sleep in a bed in the Nether, the End, and custom dimensions in which they are disabled causes it to explode and set fire to surrounding blocks; unless /gamerule respawnBlocksExplode\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] is set to false.[2] The explosion has power 5, which is stronger than TNT (4), but not as strong as a charged creeper or end crystal (6). The explosion centers on the head part of the bed. Villagers can sleep normally in any dimension without the bed being blown up.[3] Upon death from a bed explosion, the message \"(Player) was killed by [Intentional Game Design]\" appears. The player must be close to the bed to sleep. If the player is close enough to interact with the bed, but not close enough to sleep in it, the message \"You may not rest now, the bed is too far away\"\u200c[JE  only]/\"Bed is too far away\"\u200c[BE  only] appears. A player must be within 2 blocks of the bed in Java Edition or 3 blocks in Bedrock Edition to use the bed. If a \"monster\" is within 8 blocks of the bed horizontally (in the X- and Z-axis), and 5 blocks vertically (in the Y-axis), the message \"You may not rest now, there are monsters nearby\" appears and the player is prevented from sleeping until the monsters leave or are killed. Most hostile mobs, as well as some neutral mobs prevent players from sleeping, as shown in the table below.\n\n    Mob,Prevent the player from sleeping\n\n    Blaze,Yes\n\n    Chicken Jockey,When hostile\u200c [ JE only ] /Yes\u200c [ BE only ]\n\n    Creeper,Yes\n\n    Drowned,Yes\n\n    Endermite,Yes\n\n    Enderman,When hostile\n\n    Ender Dragon,No\n\n    Evoker,Yes\n\n    Ghast,No\n\n    Giant,Yes\n\n    \"Guardian , Elder Guardian\",Yes\n\n    Hoglin,No\n\n    Illusioner,Yes\n\n    Killer Bunny,No\n\n    Magma Cube,No\u200c [ JE only ] /Yes\u200c [ BE only ]\n\n    Piglin,No\n\n    Piglin Brute,Yes\n\n    Pillager,Yes\n\n    Phantom,Yes\n\n    Ravager,Yes\n\n    Shulker,No\n\n    Silverfish,Yes\n\n    \"Skeleton , Skeleton Horseman , Stray , Wither Skeleton\",Yes\n\n    \"Spider , Cave Spider , Spider Jockey\",Yes\n\n    Slime,No\u200c [ JE only ] /Yes\u200c [ BE only ]\n\n    Vex,Yes\n\n    Vindicator,Yes\n\n    Warden,Yes\n\n    Witch,Yes\n\n    Wither,Yes\n\n    Zoglin,Yes\n\n    \"Zombie , Zombie Villager , Husk\",Yes\n\n    Zombified Piglin,When hostile\u200c [ JE only ] /Yes\u200c [ BE only ]\n\n\n    If the player has not entered a bed and didn't die for 3 in-game days, phantoms can spawn unless /gamerule doInsomnia is set to false. in Java Edition, this can be verified by checking if the \"Time Since Last Rest\" statistic is greater than 1.00 h. A hostile mob can wake a player that is sleeping. The player also cannot sleep in a bed occupied by another player, resulting in the message, \"This bed is occupied\". A player can, however, sleep in a bed being used by a villager. The player may first wake the villager (pressing use on the villager) and then quickly enter the bed before the villager can lie down again. The villager reclaims the bed after the player wakes. The villager is kicked out of its bed when a player attempts to sleep there. A player also cannot sleep while on fire, while poisoned, or while starving. If all sleeping requirements are met and the player enters a bed, the player is positioned in the bed. The player falls asleep as the screen fades to black. In Bedrock Edition, the sleeping animation slowly lowers the player into bed. Once all players in a world are asleep, after 5 seconds (100 ticks) the time of day changes to sunrise. (time 0) During this time, the chat window is focused, and the player can leave the bed by clicking the Leave Bed button. Waterlogged beds\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] cannot be slept in unless the player or villager has the Water Breathing or Conduit Power status effects. Attempting to use a waterlogged bed otherwise does not display any message.[4] Beds displaying an error above the hotbar is a feature exclusive to beds; other blocks that cannot be used do not display such a message.[5] If there are two or more blocks of space above the bed, then the player can wake up on the bed. If there is less than two blocks above the bed and there is room on the side, then the player wakes up on the side of the bed. If there is no space on the side of the bed and there is less than two blocks above the bed, then the player still wakes up on top of the bed, but suffocates if it's a solid block. Villagers always wake up on top of the bed, meaning they can suffocate if there isn't enough room above the bed. Sleeping changes the time of day to sunrise and resets the weather cycle, changing the weather to clear conditions. In Java Edition, the weather cycle is only reset if it is currently raining or snowing. The player wakes up next to the bed, facing the bed. Sleeping does not accelerate processes that take place over time such as the growth of crops or smelting. If /gamerule doDaylightCycle is false, the player instead wakes up in the night. To skip the night in multiplayer, all players in the Overworld must be in bed at the same time. Pressing the Leave Bed button is not necessary in this case. The percentage of players that need to sleep to skip the night can be customized with the game rule playersSleepingPercentage. Villagers are unable to skip the night by sleeping in beds, unlike players. If the bed is destroyed while the player is in it, due to for example an explosion or by another player, the player wakes prematurely and the night does not pass. Once a player has entered a bed (or right clicked the bed during daytime), their spawn point is set to the location of that bed. In Java Edition, multiple players can set their spawn point on a single bed. In Bedrock Edition, the last player to use a specific bed is the only player who can respawn there, and players who had previously slept there respawn at the world spawn. Using a bed in the daytime likewise sets the spawn point, without actually entering the bed. When a bed explodes, it does not set the spawn point. The message \"Respawn point set\" is displayed in chat when the respawn point is successfully changed. The check for a bed is made only when the player respawns. This means that the bed can be destroyed and replaced or even reoriented, but as long as there is a bed present in the same location, the player can respawn there. If a player's bed is absent, or if the area around the bed is made unsuitable for respawning (see below), a message is displayed saying You have no home bed or respawn anchor, or it was obstructed\u200c[Java Edition  only]/Your home bed was missing or obstructed\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only], and the player respawns at the world spawn point. When choosing where to respawn the player, the northwesternmost (lowest X- and Z-coordinates) location of the seven blocks adjacent to the head of the bed is chosen first. If this location is obstructed, the next choice is to its south (+Z), rather than the east (+X). Only when all seven locations around the head are obstructed are the three remaining ones adjacent to the foot then to be considered. For a location to be unobstructed, the block at the level of the bed must be air or non-solid (e.g. torches, but not glass) and there must be a space with a solid block below it and two non-colliding blocks for the player to stand in 0-2 blocks below the bed. It does not matter if the bed itself has blocks above it. Putting a slab one block above a bed can act as a two block tall space, as the bed is half a block tall. The bed never spawns the player on or directly below itself even if all other locations are obstructed. If a bed is obstructed, the player's spawn point is cleared after they respawn. That is, even if the bed is subsequently made usable again, the player continues to respawn at the world spawn until interacting with the bed again. Specifically, when interacting with it, the location of the head of the bed is saved as the spawn point, and if a bed is in that space (whether it is the foot or the head) then the respawn works. This can be observed by reorienting the bed with its head in the same location. Interacting with it does not produce a \"Respawn point set\" message as the game doesn't change the saved spawn point. If a bed is reoriented so that its foot is in this space, it still functions on the next respawn, but it can also be interacted with to update the spawn point to the new head of the bed and cause a \"Respawn point set\" message. Attempting the reverse, reorienting the bed so that it overlaps the original location of the foot, results in a respawn at world spawn. However, the location of the foot of the bed is also saved. If the bed is moved so that part of it overlaps the original location of the head, it can be observed that the same locations need to be obstructed to stop spawning. It is possible to respawn 2 blocks away from the bed this way.\n\n  Bouncing\n    Falling onto a bed bounces the player with 66% strength \u2013 the bouncing-up velocity is 66% of the impact velocity. The player also takes 50% of normal fall damage. Baby villagers bounce on beds during the day. If the player is falling while sleeping requirements are met, and presses use on a bed within reach before hitting the ground, the fall damage is delayed until the player wakes. A player can bounce on a bed while another player or villager is sleeping on it without waking the player or the villager up. Villagers can be pushed onto beds, as the bed is half a block tall.\n\n  Curing\n    Each bed in the vicinity of a zombie villager has a chance to speed up the process of curing the zombie villager. Iron bars (such as in a prison cell) also have this effect.\n\n  Placement\n    Beds require two blocks of floor space. Placement requires at least 2 blocks from the player's facing direction. When placed, the foot of the bed is placed on the block selected and the head of the bed on the block farther away from the player. In Bedrock Edition, beds require solid blocks below them when placed. However, the bed remains in place if its supporting blocks are later removed. In Java Edition, beds do not require supporting blocks and can be placed anywhere, provided there is enough room.\n\n",

When the spot a sugar cane block is placed in becomes unsuitable, such as when the supporting block is removed, the sugar cane block uproots and drops as an item. In Bedrock Edition, sugar cane uproots immediately after all adjacent water is removed. In Java Edition, sugar cane uproots on the next block update or random tick. A sugar cane block drops itself as an item if a piston tries to push it (trying to pull it does nothing) or moves a block into its space.\n\n    Block,Sugar Cane\n\n    Hardness,0\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.05\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Sugar cane can generate naturally near water, as two (11\u204418 chance), three (5\u204418 chance), or four (2\u204418 chance) blocks tall. Rare taller sugar canes can be found if the world generator places two smaller canes on top of each other. It generates in approximately 0.8 sugar cane per chunk seeing as how they only generate near bodies of water. Sugar canes attempt to generate 10 times in any Overworld biome, which requires water. An extra 10 attempts are made in swamp biomes, and 50 in desert biomes, which makes sugar cane twice as frequent in swamps and six times as frequent in desert biomes, making the banks of rivers that cut through deserts lined with sugar canes. Sugar cane cannot generate in caves in Java Edition.[1]\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders can sell sugar cane for an emerald.\n\nUsage\n    Due to its water-displacing properties, sugar cane can interestingly be used to create underwater paths, allowing players to move at normal speed and breathe if it is two blocks in height.\u200c[Java Edition  only][2] Sugar cane takes on a different shade of green depending on the biome in which it is placed.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Paper,Sugar Cane,\"[[None, None, None], ['', '', ''], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n    Sugar,Sugar Cane,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Farming\n    Sugar cane can generate naturally up to any number of blocks tall, but grow only to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top sugar cane block has received 16 random block ticks (i.e. on average every 18 minutes on Java Edition or 54 minutes on Bedrock Edition, but the actual rate can vary widely). \nSugar cane must be planted on a grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, podzol, mycelium, sand, red sand, suspicious sand, moss block, or mud that is directly adjacent to water, waterlogged block, or frosted ice (not merely above or diagonal to water), or on top of another sugar cane block. The adjacent water block can be covered with another block, whether opaque or transparent, and sugar cane can still be placed and grow next to it. Sugar cane grows regardless of light level, even in complete darkness. In Bedrock Edition, bone meal can be used to instantly grow sugar cane to three blocks. Only one bone meal is consumed. In Java Edition, bone meal cannot be used on sugar cane.[3] On average, it takes 18 minutes for a single block of sugar cane to grow 3 blocks tall.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing sugar cane into a composter has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\nList of colors\n  Java Edition\n    These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

It is a source of flint, which has a chance to drop when gravel is broken.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Gravel can be broken using any tool, but a shovel is the quickest. When broken, it has a 10% chance of dropping flint instead of the gravel itself. The flint received can be controlled with enchantments: Silk Touch removes the chance of dropping flint; Fortune increases the chance to 14% at the level I, 25% at level II, and 100%[needs\u00a0testing] at level III.[1][2]\n\n    Block,Gravel\n\n    Hardness,0.6\n\n    Tool,Shovel\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,0.9\n\n    Wooden,0.45\n\n    Stone,0.25\n\n    Iron,0.15\n\n    Diamond,0.15\n\n    Netherite,0.1\n\n    Golden,0.1\n\n\n    If gravel falls onto a non-full block, it drops as an item and does not drop flint.[3][4]\n\n  Natural generation\n    Gravel is generated in disks in rivers, shallow oceans and small pools of water; in windswept gravelly hills biomes covering most of the surface; underwater covering the bottom of sufficiently deep rivers and normal, cold, and frozen ocean biomes, as well as their deep variants; and in the form of strips in stony shores. Gravel can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore features. Gravel attempts to generate 14 times per chunk in ore features of size 0-160, at all levels and in all biomes. It can replace stone, granite, andesite, diorite, polished granite\u200c[BE  only], polished andesite\u200c[BE  only], polished diorite\u200c[BE  only], tuff\u200c[JE  only], and deepslate\u200c[JE  only]. Gravel can also generate as part of cold ocean ruins and trail ruins. In the nether, gravel generates naturally in layers along the shores of the lava sea, in all biomes except crimson and warped forests. The layers are one block deep in nether wastes, and 3-5 blocks deep in soul sand valley and basalt deltas. Ore features of gravel in the nether attempt to replace netherrack 2 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-160, from levels 5 to 41\u200c[JE  only] or 36\u200c[BE  only], in all Nether biomes except basalt deltas.\n\n  Mob loot\n    An enderman holding gravel always drops the block upon death.\n\n  Bartering\n    Piglins may barter 8-16 gravel when given a gold ingot.\n\nUsage\n    If the supporting block below a block of gravel is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the gravel block turns into a \"falling block\" entity, which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity are available in the main article listed above. When gravel falls on a player or mob, it can engulf the head, resulting in suffocation inside gravel until destroying the block, moving out of it, or dying. If falling gravel lands in a space occupied by a non-solid block (such as torches, rails, or redstone dust) or non-full block (such as slabs or soul sand[5]), it breaks and turns into a gravel item. Gravel falls slowly through a cobweb until it passes completely through, or until it touches any block, at which point it drops and becomes a gravel item. Gravel can be placed on a non-solid block without falling. Bamboo can be placed and grown on gravel.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Coarse Dirt,Dirt + Gravel,\"[[None, None, None], ['Dirt', '', None], ['', 'Dirt', None]]\",\n\n    Concrete Powder,Matching Dye + Sand + Gravel,\"[['White Dye', 'Sand', 'Sand'], ['Sand', 'Sand', ''], ['', '', '']]\",Red sand cannot be used in place of sand.

Librarian villagers do not place books into lecterns. They only stare at the lectern from less than a block away as \"working\".\n\n  Holding books\n    Lecterns can also hold a single book and quill or written book that other players can read at the same time. Right-clicking an empty one with a book and quill or written book places it. Right-clicking a lectern with a book already occupied opens an interface to read the book. Books occupying a lectern can be retrieved through the interface,\u200c[Java Edition  only] punching the lectern\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] or by destroying the lectern, even when /gamerule doTileDrops is false. Lecterns cannot hold enchanted books or normal books. Instead, right clicking the lectern with an enchanted book or a normal book does nothing and the book won't be placed.\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village has a lectern that has not been claimed by a villager, any villager has a chance to change their profession into librarian if that villager has not already chosen a job site block.\n\n  Redstone signal\n    Lecterns holding a book emit a full-strength redstone pulse that is one game tick long (0.5 redstone ticks) when a page is turned. A redstone comparator also records book reading and sends a signal, depending on what page the player is currently on. Because Bedrock Edition displays two pages of the book at once, the same signal strength increments require double the number of pages. For Java Edition a book with only 1 page gives maximum signal strength, however page 1 always gives 1 signal strength if the book contains at least 2 pages. Due to this, to calculate the signal strength S of books with more than 1 page, use the following formula: S=\u230a1+14(P\u22121)M\u22121\u230b Where \u230a\u230b is the \"floor\" operation (round down), M is the maximum number of pages the book on the lectern has, and P is the current page number the lectern is turned to. This is most noticeable when a book has 2 pages where the signal strength is either 1 on page 1 or 15 on page 2. A book that would step up or down in increments of 1 per page would be 15 pages long. For Bedrock Edition the formula is slightly different. Due to Bedrock Edition showing 2 pages at once and counting a change to the book's output only if the highest even numbered page contains information, a redstone comparator treats books with 3 pages the same as those with 1 or 2 pages of information, the same as how Java Edition would treat a book with just 1 page. For 4 or more pages of information use the following formula to calculate signal strength. S=\u230a1+14(P\u2032\u22121)M\u2032\u22121\u230b In this case M\u2032 is half of the maximum page number rounded down, and P\u2032 is half of the current highest page number containing data displayed on the book interface, rounded down. Rounding down is required to eliminate the discrepancy caused by books containing an odd number of pages. For example, a book with 8 pages gives a signal strength of 15 when looking at pages 7-8. A book with 9 pages has a signal strength of 15 when looking at either pages 7-8 and 9-10. In Bedrock Edition, a book that steps up or down in increments of 1 per page turned must be exactly 30 pages long, with information left on page 30.\n\n  Fuel\n    Lecterns can be used as fuel in furnaces to smelt 1.5 items.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Lecterns can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sound.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    Sweet berries are a food item obtained from sweet berry bushes and are used to plant them. Sweet berry bushes are quick-growing, bonemealable plants that grow sweet berries, and damage and slow players and most mobs moving through them. They can be found naturally in taiga and snowy taiga biomes.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Sweet berry bushes can be mined instantly with any tool or by hand. A mature sweet berry bush yields 2\u20133 sweet berries. On its third growth stage, it yields 1\u20132 sweet berries. Each level of Fortune can increase the amount of drops by 1. In PlayStation 4 Edition, the sweet berries drop into the player's inventory. In other editions, they drop on the ground.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Berry bushes commonly generate in taiga and snowy taiga biomes. Each chunk has a 1\u204412 chance to generate sweet berry bushes in random patches. They also generate in both old growth pine taiga\u200c[JE  only] and old growth spruce taiga\u200c[JE  only].\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Sweet Berries,Village,Taiga\u00a0house\u00a0chest,1\u20137,\"40.6% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Sweet Berries\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20137\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.4058792240743314, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Village\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Taiga house chest\"\" }\"\n\n\n  Post-generation\n    Sweet berries can be collected from a sweet berry bush by using or breaking it, which yield 1\u20132 sweet berries in its third growth stage, and 2\u20133 sweet berries in its final growth stage.\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Placing sweet berries on a grass block, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland\u200c[Java Edition  only], podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud, or muddy mangrove roots creates a small sweet berry bush that eventually becomes a fully grown sweet berry bush.\n\n  Growth\n    A sweet berry bush grows through four stages after it is planted. Its first growth stage is a small bush without any berries. It becomes a grown plant in its second stage, and produces berries in its third and fourth growth stage. The bush needs to be in light level 9 or greater to grow. Using bone meal on it increases its growth stage by one, and at full maturity, ejects the sweet berry item. The bush can be placed on a 1 block high space, but it cannot grow with a full, non-transparent block immediately above it.\n\n  Food\n    To eat sweet berries, press and hold use while it is selected in the hotbar. Eating one restores 2 () hunger and 0.4\u200c[JE  only] / 1.2\u200c[BE  only] hunger saturation.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing sweet berries into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Breeding\n    Sweet berries can be fed to foxes to breed them. Foxes are similar to cats when being fed as a wild animal; a sudden movement by the player may cause the fox to flee even if the player holds sweet berries. A baby fox bred by a player trusts the player and does not flee.\n\n  Trading\n    Master-level butcher villagers offer to buy 10 sweet berries for an emerald.\n\n  Entity movement\n    A sweet berry bush (at any stage) slows down all entities (except items) passing through it. At stage 1 and higher, it causes damage. Foxes are immune to both characteristics, however. Sweet berry bushes deal 1 damage every 0.5 seconds, only if the entity is moving in the hitbox of the bush. Entities that move through sweet berry bushes slow down to about 34.05% of their normal speed, similar to how a cobweb slows down mobs to 15% of normal speed. This makes it impossible to jump a full block while inside the bush. Mobs at standard block height in a minecart are not damaged when the minecart is pushed through sweet berries. Players in a sweet berry bush take no damage except from horizontal movement, but are unable to jump out of the bush, similar to a cobweb.\n\n  Bees\n    Bees pollinate sweet berry bushes, and then increase the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n",

A cactus also removes and drops itself as an item if a piston tries to push it, or moves a block into its space. Trying to pull it with a sticky piston does nothing. Using a sign on the side of a cactus causes both the sign and the cactus to drop as items.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Cacti naturally occur in desert and badlands biomes (twice more common in desert than in badlands). They generate as one (11\u204418 chance), two (5\u204418 chance), or three (2\u204418 chance) blocks tall.

A cactus breaks itself (and drops as an item) if any block with a solid material, or lava, occupies any of the 4 horizontally adjacent blocks. It also breaks if on the sand and the block above is water or lava. When any entity, including players and mobs, touches a cactus, 1 damage is taken every 0.5 seconds. Damage from touching a cactus is reduced by armor, but touching it also damages the armor. Mobs do not avoid cacti when they pathfind. A cactus destroys any item that come into contact with it, including other cactus in item form. Falling blocks such as sand and gravel are not destroyed when falling onto cactus; instead, they are transformed into item form (as happens when it falls into any block with a hitbox that has a height less than 1, such as slabs). The item created in this case will sometimes (though not always) be destroyed by the cactus. The conversion to an item applies even when the falling block is a cactus (which is possible with /summon). When a minecart hits a cactus block, the minecart drops as an item and is often destroyed, although a hopper can pick it up faster. A cactus can also be placed in a flower pot, where it is rendered harmless. A cactus (excluding its spikes) is 7\u20448 of a block in width (the same as chests) and a full block in height, however the collision box is 15\u204416 of a block high.\n\n  Farming\n    Cacti naturally grow to a height of three blocks, adding a block of height when the top cactus block has received 16 random ticks (i.e. on average every 18 minutes, but the actual rate can vary widely).

Ancient debris never generates naturally exposed to air and can replace only netherrack, basalt, and blackstone.[note 1] In Java Edition, up to two clusters may generate per chunk: one cluster of 0\u20133 ancient debris attempts to generate with a triangle distribution from levels 8 to 24, and an additional cluster of 0\u20132 ancient debris attempts to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119. On average, Y-level 15 has the most ancient debris. There is an average of 1.65 ancient debris blocks per chunk[needs\u00a0testing], with a normal maximum of 5. However, it is technically possible for up to 11 ancient debris to be found in a single chunk; adjacent chunks can generate blobs on the border with up to 2 blocks spawning in an adjacent chunk. As of Java Edition 1.16.5, on average they generate 1.56 ores per chunk. Given this number, and that there are 32768 blocks in a chunk (16\u00d7128\u00d716), there is approximately a 0.004% chance that any randomly selected block will be an ancient debris block. In Bedrock Edition, up to five clusters may generate per chunk: two clusters of 0\u20133 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 23, and an additional three clusters of 0\u20132 ancient debris attempt to generate evenly from levels 8 to 119.\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Ancient Debris,Bastion remnant,Generic\u00a0chest,1,\"13.5% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Ancient Debris\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 1, \"\"chance\"\": 0.1348314606741573, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Generic chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Treasure\u00a0chest,2,\"12.7% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Ancient Debris\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 2, \"\"chance\"\": 0.1274951989026063, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Treasure chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Hoglin\u00a0stable\u00a0chest,2,\"5.7% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Ancient Debris\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 2, \"\"chance\"\": 0.05681818181818177, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Hoglin stable chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bedrock Edition\n\n    Ancient Debris,Bastion remnant,Hoglin\u00a0stable\u00a0chest,1,\"5.7% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Ancient Debris\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 1, \"\"chance\"\": 0.05681818181818177, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Hoglin stable chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Generic\u00a0chest,1,\"13.5% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Ancient Debris\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 1, \"\"chance\"\": 0.1348314606741573, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Generic chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Treasure\u00a0chest,2,\"12.7% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Ancient Debris\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": 2, \"\"chance\"\": 0.1274951989026063, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Bastion remnant\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Treasure chest\"\" }\"\n\n\nUsage\n  Smelting ingredient\n    Ancient debris can be smelted using a furnace or blast furnace, which gives the player netherite scrap.

A dropper can be placed so that its output faces in any direction, including up or down. When placed, the dropper's output faces toward the player. With default textures, the droppers output side looks like a face when positioned for horizontal output. Otherwise, the output side has a square hole. In Java Edition, droppers cannot be moved by pistons.\n\n  Container\n    A dropper has 9 slots of inventory space. To open the dropper GUI, use the Use Item control. To move items between the dropper inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the dropper GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the dropper GUI, use the Esc control. By default, the GUI of a dropper is labeled \"Dropper\". A dropper's GUI label can be changed by naming the dropper in an anvil before placing it. In Java Edition, droppers can also be renamed by using the /data command (for example, to label a dropper at (0,64,0) \"Alice's Dropper\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Alice's Dropper\"'}). In Java Edition, a dropper can be \"locked\" (or subsequently unlocked) by setting the dropper's Lock tag with the /data command. If a dropper's Lock tag is not blank, the dropper cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a dropper at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"Alice's Key\" can access the dropper, use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Alice's Key\"}.\n\n  Redstone component\n    A dropper can be used to eject items, or push items into another container. Activation A dropper can be activated by:\nan adjacent active power component (Exceptions: a redstone torch does not turn ON a dropper it is attached to)\nan adjacent powered opaque block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)\na powered redstone repeater or redstone comparator facing the dropper\npowered redstone dust configured to point at the dropper, or on top of it; a dropper is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction. In addition to the methods above, droppers in Java Edition can also be activated by quasi-connectivity. A dropper activates if one of the methods above would activate a mechanism component in the block above the dropper, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dropper is air or a transparent block), but only when the dropper receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dropper). A dropper has a 2 redstone tick (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) delay between activation and a response. During this time, additional inputs are ignored. Behavior When activated, a dropper waits 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) and then ejects one item from its inventory. The dropper does not continue to eject items while activated \u2014 ejection occurs only on the initial activation (the rising edge of an input signal). To eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dropper with a clock circuit. If multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection. The slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dropper is initially activated, thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dropper between its activation and item dispensing. If the dropper is facing a container, the ejected item is transferred into the container. If the container it is facing is full, or the item cannot be inserted into the container, the dropper does not activate. Otherwise, the item is ejected in the direction the dropper is facing, as if a player had used the Drop control. Even items that would be treated differently by a dispenser (such as arrows) are simply ejected by a dropper. A dropper makes a clicking noise (the random.click sound event) when activated empty or when ejecting items into air. It is silent when it successfully transfers an item into any kind of chest or barrel, or another dropper. A dropper is an opaque block, so powering it directly can cause adjacent mechanism components (including other droppers) to activate as well. A line of droppers, each pushing items into the next dropper, is known as a dropper pipe. A dropper pipe must be clocked to move items, but can be clocked to move items faster than a hopper pipe's transfer rate. When a dropper pipe pushes items upward, it is known as a droppervator (short for \"dropper elevator\"). Some containers interact with droppers in specific ways: Barrel, Boat with Chest, Dispenser, Dropper\nDroppers interact normally with barrels, boats with chests, dispensers, and other droppers. Brewing Stand\nA dropper facing toward a brewing stand from above deposits only into the ingredient slot and it can insert only valid brewing ingredients. A dropper facing toward a brewing stand from the sides or from below can deposit only blaze powder in the fuel slot, or filled bottles into the three brew slots. Chest, Trapped Chest\nLarge chests and large trapped chests are treated as a single container: a dropper depositing into a large chest fills up the entire chest. Trapped chests being accessed by a player trigger any adjacent droppers, depositing items into the chest if they are facing toward it. Chiseled Bookshelf\nA dropper facing toward a chiseled bookshelf from any direction can insert books, books and quills, written books, enchanted books, and knowledge books. Crafter\u200c[upcoming: JE 1.21\u00a0& BE 1.21.0]\nDroppers can insert ingredients in the crafting grid. Items are distributed in enabled slots, going left to right starting from the first row; if the crafter has all item slots filled then items are added to the lowest count item stack of the same type. Composter\nA dropper facing toward a composter from above can push compostable items into the composter, with a chance of increasing the compost level as if the player used the item on the composter. Decorated Pot\u200c[upcoming: JE 1.20.3\u00a0& BE 1.20.50]\nDroppers can deposit up to a stack of a single type of item into a decorated pot. Items are not inserted if the decorated pot is full or the pot contains a different item. Ender Chest\nDroppers cannot interact with ender chests in any way. Furnace, Blast Furnace, Smoker\nA dropper facing toward a furnace from above deposits only into the ingredient slot. It can insert any item, including items that can't be smelted by the furnace. A dropper facing toward a furnace from the sides or from below deposits only into the fuel slot, and only items that are usable as fuel. Hopper\nA dropper facing toward a hopper can insert items even if the hopper is locked by an active redstone signal. Jukebox\nA dropper can insert music discs into a jukebox from any direction. The dropper does not activate if the jukebox is already playing a disc. Lectern\nDroppers cannot interact with lecterns in any way. Minecart with Chest, Minecart with Hopper\nA dropper fills chest minecarts and hopper minecarts if any part of the entity's hitbox is within the dropper's target block-space. A dropper can fill a hopper minecart even if the hopper minecart has been locked by an activator rail. Shulker Box\nDroppers cannot put shulker boxes into other shulker boxes. Otherwise, droppers interact with shulker boxes normally.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Droppers can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Crafter,Iron Ingot + Crafting Table + Redstone Dust + Dropper,\"[['Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot'], ['Iron Ingot', 'Crafting Table', 'Iron Ingot'], ['Redstone Dust', '', 'Redstone Dust']]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A redstone comparator is a block that can produce an output signal from its front by reading chests, lecterns, beehives and similar blocks, or repeat a signal without changing its strength.

In Bedrock Edition, a comparator can also be placed on walls and fences. For more information about placement on transparent blocks, see Opacity/Placement. The redstone comparator has a front and a back \u2014 the arrow on the top of the comparator points to the front. When placed, the comparator faces away from the player. The comparator has two miniature redstone torches at the back and one at the front. The back torches turn on when the comparator's output is greater than zero (the arrow on top also turns red). The front torch has two states that can be toggled by using the comparator: The redstone comparator can take a signal strength input from its rear as well as from both sides. Side inputs are accepted only from redstone dust, block of redstone, redstone repeaters, other comparators, and observers in specific scenarios. The redstone comparator's front is its output. It takes 1 redstone tick (2 game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag) for signals to move through a redstone comparator, either from the rear or from the sides. This applies to changing signal strengths as well as simply to turning on and off. Redstone comparators check their power state before their scheduled ticks update. This results in redstone comparators not usually responding to 1-tick fluctuations of power or signal strength \u2014 for example, a 1-clock input is treated as always off from the side, and always on from the rear. This happens because the signal changes back to its original state before the redstone comparator checks its input states. However, certain setups such as powering any input with two separate observer pulses at the same time causes a redstone comparator to respond to 2 gametick pulses. The redstone comparator has four functions: maintain signal strength, compare signal strength, subtract signal strength, and measure certain block states (primarily the fullness of containers).\n\n  Maintain signal strength\n    A redstone comparator with no powered sides outputs the same signal strength as its rear input, with a 1 tick delay.\n\n  Compare signal strength\n    A redstone comparator in comparison mode (front torch down and unpowered) compares its rear input to its two side inputs. If either side input is greater than the rear input, the comparator output turns off. If neither side input is greater than the rear input, the comparator outputs the same signal strength as its rear input. The formula for calculating the output signal strength is as follows: output = rear \u00d7 [left \u2264 rear AND right \u2264 rear]\n\n  Subtract signal strength\n    A redstone comparator in subtraction mode (front torch up and powered) subtracts the signal strength of the higher side input from the signal strength of the rear input. output = max(rear \u2212 max(left, right), 0) For example: if the signal strength is 6 at the left input, 7 at the right input and 4 at the rear, the output signal has a strength of max(4 \u2212 max(6, 7), 0) = max(4\u22127, 0) = max(\u22123, 0) = 0. If the signal strength is 9 at the rear, 2 at the right input and 5 at the left input, the output signal has a strength of max(9 \u2212 max(2, 5), 0) = max(9\u22125, 0) = 4.\n\n  Measure block state\n    A redstone comparator treats certain blocks behind it as power sources and outputs a signal strength proportional to the block's state. The comparator may be separated from the measured block by an opaque block. However, in Java Edition, if the opaque block is powered to signal strength 15, then the comparator outputs 15 no matter the fullness of the container.[1]\n\n    Containers,\u200c [ upcoming ],furnace; blast furnace; smoker,hopper; minecart with hopper; brewing stand,dispenser; dropper,chest; minecart with chest; shulker box; barrel,,,,jukebox\n\n    \"\"\n\n    \"\"\n\n    Total Slots,1,3,5,9,27,54,1\n\n    Power Level,Number of Items,Music Disc\n\n    0,0,0,0,0,0,0,No disc\n\n    1,1,1,1,1,1,1,\"\"\"13\"\"\"\n\n    2,5,14,23,42,1s 60,3s 55,\"\"\"cat\"\"\"\n\n    3,10,28,46,1s 19,3s 55,7s 46,\"\"\"blocks\"\"\"\n\n    4,14,42,1s 5,1s 60,5s 51,11s 37,\"\"\"chirp\"\"\"\n\n    5,19,55,1s 28,2s 37,7s 46,15s 28,\"\"\"far\"\"\"\n\n    6,23,1s 5,1s 51,3s 14,9s 42,19s 19,\"\"\"mall\"\"\"\n\n    7,28,1s 19,2s 10,3s 55,11s 37,23s 10,\"\"\"mellohi\"\"\"\n\n    8,32,1s 32,2s 32,4s 32,13s 32,27s,\"\"\"stal\"\"\"\n\n    9,37,1s 46,2s 55,5s 10,15s 28,30s 55,\"\"\"strad\"\"\"\n\n    10,42,1s 60,3s 14,5s 51,17s 23,34s 46,\"\"\"ward\"\"\"\n\n    11,46,2s 10,3s 37,6s 28,19s 19,38s 37,\"\"\"11\"\"\"\n\n    12,51,2s 23,3s 60,7s 5,21s 14,42s 28,\"\"\"wait\"\"\"\n\n    13,55,2s 37,4s 19,7s 46,23s 10,46s 19,\"\"\"Pigstep\"\"\"\n\n    14,60,2s 51,4s 42,8s 23,25s 5,50s 10,\"\"\"Otherside\"\" \"\"Relic\"\"\"\n\n    15,1s,3s,5s,9s,27s,54s,\"\"\"5\"\"\"\n\n\n    A redstone comparator can output a signal indicating how full a container is. (0 for empty, 15 for full, etc.) The table on the right is described more in detail, later in this section. Containers that can be measured by a comparator include: Generally speaking, the comparator output signal strength represents the average fullness of the slots, based on how many of that item form a full stack (64, 16, or 1 for non-stackable items). The Minimum Items for Container Signal Strength table (right) shows the minimum full-stack-equivalent (FSE) to produce different signal strengths from common containers. A full-stack-equivalent quantifies how many normal 64-stackable items are needed to output a corresponding signal strength. The 's' is a constant 64, with the additional amount needed following after. One may also consider the terms: cumulative-weight or weighted-sum instead of full-stack-equivalent. Items that stack to a max of 16  (snowballs, signs, ender pearls, etc.), contribute +4 to the full-stack-equivalent for each unity (count of 1 item). Similarly, items that stack to 1 (minecart, boat, etc.) contribute +64, and items that stack to 64 contribute +1. Example 1: 3 ender pearls contribute a 3\u00d74 = 12 full-stack-equivalent. Example 2: 16 ender pearls and 60 redstone dust contributes a 16\u00d74 + 60\u00d71 = 124 full-stack-equivalent. Example 3: 1 minecart and 60 redstone dust contributes a 1\u00d764 + 60\u00d71 = 124 full-stack-equivalent. Example 4: To produce a signal strength of 10 from a hopper, one requires a full-stack-equivalent of at least 3s + 14 = 206 but strictly less than than 3s + 37 = 229. This can be done with 3 minecarts, and 14 dirt. When a comparator measures a large chest or large trapped chest, it measures the entire large chest (54 slots), not just the half directly behind the comparator. A chest or trapped chest that cannot be opened (either because it has an opaque block, ocelot, or cat above it) always produces an output of 0 no matter how many items are in the container \u2014 shulker boxes can always be measured, even if they cannot open. Calculating signal strength from items When a container is empty, the output is off. When it is not empty, the output signal strength is calculated as follows: signal strength = floor(1 + ((sum of all slots' fullnesses) / (number of slots in container)) \u00d7 14) fullness of a slot = number of items in slot / max stack size for this type of item Example: 300 blocks in a dispenser (which has 9 slots), where each block stacks to a maximum of 64 has a 300 full-stack-equivalent. This produces an output with a signal strength of 8: Calculating items from signal strength It can be useful in redstone circuits to use containers with comparators to create signals of a specific strength. The number of items required in a container to produce a signal of desired strength is calculated as follows: items required = max(desired signal strength, roundup((total slots in container \u00d7 64 / 14) \u00d7 (desired signal strength \u2212 1))) Example: To use a furnace (which has 3 slots) to create a strength 9 signal, players need 110 items: Some non-container blocks can also be measured by a redstone comparator: Beehive and Bee Nest A hive or nest outputs a signal strength equal to the amount of honey in the hive/nest. Cake A cake outputs a signal strength relative to the amount of cake remaining.  Each slice is worth 2 signal strength, with 7 total slices, for an output of 14 for a full cake. Cauldron A cauldron outputs different signal strengths depending on how much water or powdered snow is inside. From completely empty to completely full, the output values are 0, 1, 2, and 3. If lava is inside, the strength is always 3. Chiseled Bookshelf A chiseled bookshelf outputs a signal strength between 1 and 6 indicating the last slot interacted with. When no slot has been interacted with yet, it outputs 0. Crafter\u200c[upcoming: JE 1.21\u00a0& BE 1.21.0]\nA crafter outputs a signal strength equal to the number of crafting slots that are either disabled or occupied by an item. An empty crafter with no disabled slots does not output any signal through a comparator. A crafter with every slot either disabled or containing at least one item outputs a signal strength of nine through a comparator. Composter A composter outputs different signal strengths depending on the level inside. From completely empty to completely full, the output values are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Copper Bulb\u200c[upcoming: JE 1.21\u00a0& BE 1.21.0]\nA copper bulb at any oxidation stage emits a full signal of 15 when lit and 0 otherwise. Command Block A command block stores the \"success count\" of the last command executed, which represents the number of times the most recently used command of this command block succeeded. A \"success\" is defined by the command's success conditions: if a red error message is returned in the chat, the command was not successful. Most commands can succeed once per execution, but certain commands (such as those that accept players as arguments) can succeed multiple times, and the comparator outputs the number of times it succeeded (maximum 15 when sent to redstone dust, but in the code it is able to go up to the 32-bit integer limit, and can be used in contraptions with no redstone dust with those values). A command block continues to store the success count of the last command executed until it executes its command again, thus the comparator continues to output the same signal strength even after the command block is no longer being activated (it doesn't turn off when the signal to the command block turns off). End Portal Frame An end portal frame outputs a full signal of 15 if it contains an eye of ender and 0 otherwise. Item Frame A comparator can measure the state of an item frame's contents. An item frame comparator outputs 0 if the item frame is empty, or 1 to 8 for any item depending on its rotation: 1 at initial placement, plus 1 for each 45\u00b0 of rotation for a maximum of 8. For an item frame that holds a map, a unit of rotation is 90\u00b0 instead of 45\u00b0, but a comparator still outputs power levels 1 to 8. It takes two full rotations to cycle through all comparator outputs, and each orientation of the map corresponds to two output levels that differ by 4. The comparator must be placed behind the block the item frame is attached to, facing away from the item frame. The block must be a full block, and the item frame cannot be submerged in water. Having a sign in the same block as the item frame prevents the frame from sending a signal as well.\u200c[Java Edition  only] Jukebox A jukebox outputs a signal strength indicating which music disc is currently playing. See the Minimum Items for Container Signal Strength table above. Lectern A lectern outputs a signal strength that depends on what page the player is currently on. The calculation used is:\nsignal strength = floor(1 + ((current page - 1) / (number of pages in book - 1)) \u00d7 14)\nThis results in page 1 having a signal strength of 1, and the last page having a signal strength of 15. The exception is a single page book, which outputs a signal strength of 15.\nFor example, a book with 15 pages outputs a signal equal to the current page number.  A book with 5 pages outputs signal strengths of 1, 4, 8, 11 and 15 for the different pages. A book with 100 pages has the signal strength increase to the next level on pages 1, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, 44, 51, 58, 65, 72, 79, 86, 93 and 100. Respawn Anchor A respawn anchor outputs a signal strength of 0, 3, 7, 11, or 15, depending on the \"charged\" value. Sculk Sensor A sculk sensor outputs a signal strength depending on the type of vibration that is detected.\n\n",

More information can be found at Opacity/Placement. When placed below a block the lantern appears to hang. They connect to chains seamlessly. Lanterns can be placed (if a support platform is presented) or hanging (if a ceiling block is presented). The type of the block (solid, opaque, transparent, etc... given the block has top/bottom solid surface) does not affect the ability to hang of a lantern, similar to torches. Press use on the targeted block or a block adjacent to the air block the lantern is going to occupy to place it. If the latter is used and both the support/ceiling block is presented: If the object the lantern is placed on receive a block update that does not support the placement of the lantern, it is removed and drop as an item (e.g: lantern on a trapdoor and the trapdoor is flipped).\n\n  Light\n    The lantern is among the most luminous of light sources, emitting a light level of 15. Lanterns also melt snow layers within 2 blocks and ice within 3 blocks (taxicab distance).\n\n",

In Java Edition, they are also technically capable of growing in dripstone caves and deep dark biomes, though it is very unlikely due to lack of grass blocks in these biomes. Natural oxeye daisies are found in plains villages. Potted oxeye daisies can also be generated in woodland mansions.\n\n  Post-generation\n    When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, flower forest, meadow, dripstone caves, or deep dark biome, oxeye daisies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 15\u00d75\u00d715 area. When bone meal is applied to a grass block in a plains, sunflower plains, or flower forest biome, oxeye daisies have a chance of generating on the targeted block and adjacent grass blocks in a 7\u00d75\u00d77 area. When bone meal is applied to an oxeye daisy that has been placed on top of a grass block, more oxeye daisies appear on top of nearby grass blocks. The flowers can appear up to 3 blocks away from the original, forming a 7\u00d77 square.\n\n  Mob loot\n    Endermen can pick up oxeye daisies, like any other one-block-tall flower, and drop one if killed while holding it.\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders may sell an oxeye daisy for a single emerald.\n\nUsage\n    Like other flowers, oxeye daisies can be used as decoration and planted on grass blocks, dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss blocks, mud, or muddy mangrove roots.

                    "context": "Overview\n    A sculk shrieker is a sculk block found in the deep dark that produces a \"shrieking\" noise when a player stands on it (regardless of sneaking) or triggers a nearby sculk sensor. Natural sculk shriekers found in the deep dark inflict Darkness and may summon a warden when triggered, but shriekers placed by players or sculk catalysts are inert and unable to summon wardens or inflict Darkness under any circumstance.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Sculk shriekers can be mined with any tool, but hoes are the quickest. It drops 5 experience when mined without Silk Touch. When a sculk shrieker is broken it loses the ability to summon the warden, even if mined with Silk Touch.\n\n    Block,Sculk Shrieker\n\n    Hardness,3\n\n    Tool,Hoe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,4.5\n\n    Wooden,2.25\n\n    Stone,1.15\n\n    Iron,0.75\n\n    Diamond,0.6\n\n    Netherite,0.5\n\n    Golden,0.4\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Sculk shriekers can be found infrequently within the deep dark biome, and they are much more common within ancient cities. These shriekers can summon the warden.\n\n  Post-generation\n    A sculk catalyst has a 1% chance of generating a sculk shrieker on top of a sculk block. These shriekers do not summon the warden.\n\nUsage\n    Sculk shriekers \"shriek\" after being activated. A sculk shrieker activates when any player stands on the black part in the center of the block, even when sneaking. Sculk shriekers are also activated by any sculk sensor triggered within an 8-block spherical radius of itself, but only if the vibration was caused by a player. However, a sculk sensor cannot activate the sculk shrieker if the line between the two contains a wool block. The shrieker shrieks for exactly 90 game ticks (4.5 seconds).\n\n  Spawning wardens\n    Sculk shriekers that naturally generate in the deep dark biome are capable of inflicting the Darkness effect upon players and summoning wardens. If a sculk shrieker is placed by a player or generated via a sculk catalyst, the tag can_summon is set to false, and therefore a warden cannot be summoned and Darkness cannot be inflicted by that sculk shrieker[1]. Each time a naturally generated sculk shrieker is activated, it adds 1 to a \"warning\" level to alert the warden. The warning level is specific to each player, not each sculk shrieker, meaning that the same player can activate a different sculk shrieker for each of the four times, and a warden still spawns on the fourth activation, even though any particular shrieker had been activated once. If a player does not activate any sculk shrieker, the warning level decreases by 1 every 10 minutes (12000 ticks). After the shrieking ends, all players in Survival or Adventure mode within 40 blocks are given the Darkness effect for 12 seconds. After a warden is summoned, a player's warning level does not reset back to 0, meaning multiple wardens can be summoned. Naturally generated sculk shriekers have a 10-second cooldown per player. This means that if a player triggers one shrieker, they are completely unable to trigger any other shrieker within 10 seconds. The cooldown period includes the 4.5-second shrieking, which means 5.5 seconds after the previous shrieking ends, the player can activate sculk shriekers again. When a player's warning level reaches level 4, the sculk shrieker attempts to spawn a warden after its shrieking ends.  If the shrieker is broken before it ends shrieking, the warden spawns immediately.  Up to 20 attempts are made to spawn a warden within an 11\u00d713\u00d711 box centered on the shrieker. If there isn't another warden within 24 blocks, a warden emerges from the ground. The warden always spawns at the highest available block. If all 20 spawning attempts fail, a loud roaring sound is played. In Java Edition, if the game rule doWardenSpawning is set to false, naturally generated sculk shriekers behave as if they are placed by a player: they do shriek, but there is no shrieking cooldown, the player's warning level does not increase, no Darkness effect is inflicted, and no warden spawns. If the player that triggered the sculk shrieker is outside the shrieker's range when the shrieking ends, the sculk shrieker does not apply the Darkness effect to any player. The player's warning level still increases by 1. It is possible to make a warden spawn from a distance, by shooting a projectile into the direction of known sensors that are near shriekers. The warnings have unique subtitles at different levels of warning: 1) \"Warden approaches.\" 2) \"Warden advances.\" 3) \"Warden draws close.\"\n\n",

Mobs cannot normally spawn on stained glass blocks. An exception to this is zombie reinforcements, which can spawn on stained glass blocks (but not stained glass panes). Stained glass blocks cannot be seen through by mobs, as they treat them as completely opaque. Mobs may look at players through stained glass, but this is purely visual. Redstone dust and components can be placed on stained glass, but cannot power stained glass. Stained glass can't cut vertical redstone. Vertical redstone can be placed on stained glass. In Java Edition, it transmits redstone signals up, not down. Otherwise, stained glass in redstone circuits is functionally the same as an upside-down slab.\n\n  Beacon beam color\n    The color of the beam may be changed by placing blocks of stained glass (or stained glass panes) anywhere above the beacon block. The beam changes colors according to the colors of glass placed above it: the first block sets the beam color, while each additional block sets the color by averaging the red, green, and blue components of the current beam color and the block's color. The color values are the same as those for the corresponding dye. This also works using hardened stained glass and hardened stained glass panes.\u200c[Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education  only] Stained glass panes have the same effect on the beam as stained glass blocks. The resulting beam color can be found as C=12n+1(c0+\u2211i=1n2i\u22121ci)where ci is the sequence of glass colors (c0 corresponds to the lowest block and cn to the highest one). As the blending algorithm is considerably simpler than that of leather-dyeing, a much larger part of the sRGB space is available.[more information needed] A player may experiment with stacking glass, although programs that calculate combinations are also available.[2] With only 15 types of stained glass you can make all colors, for example; red + white stained glass above a beacon will be pink, the more white you add, the lighter the color will be.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n",

It is even more slippery (0.989) than ice or packed ice (0.98). This allows for increased speed of items in water currents by placing the blue ice under the water current. Mobs do not travel faster in water currents on blue ice. Boats can travel even faster on blue ice than on either normal ice or packed ice, being able to reach a top speed of 72.73 m/s (as opposed to 40 m/s on ice and packed ice).  Ice tracks built from blue ice, packed ice, or a combination are useful for long-range travel in all three dimensions. Blue ice is a completely solid block and allows the placement of any objects on top. Unlike normal ice, blue ice does not melt when placed near light sources. Blue ice can be used to create basalt. When lava flows into a space which is above soul soil and next to blue ice, basalt is formed. Effectively a \"basalt generator\" when repeatedly produced. Blue ice is not a storage block, as it cannot be crafted back into packed ice.\n\n",

Apprentice-level toolsmith and weaponsmith villagers always offer to sell a bell for 36 emeralds. In Bedrock Edition, apprentice-level armorer villagers have a 1\u20443 chance to sell a bell for 36 emeralds. Apprentice-level toolsmith villagers sell bells for 36 emeralds. Journeyman-level weaponsmith villagers sell bells for 36 emeralds.\n\nUsage\n    When a bell is placed near a claimed bed, the bell is claimed, which is displayed by green particles appearing above the bell. A claimed bell defines a gathering site of a village. If the bell is broken, anger particles appear above the village leader's head. When the side of a bell is used, it produces a sound as well as a \"swaying\" animation. A bell can be rung using a redstone signal, by any projectile, by right clicking, or by dropping an item on it. Bells can be anchored to the side of blocks, ceilings, and floors. Also, if the player uses the bell while villagers are sleeping, all of the villagers wake up. Bells can be rung only from certain angles; trying from an incorrect angle does not cause the bell to ring. If a player rings a bell, the villagers run to their houses even if there is no raid.\n\n  Raid\n    When the bell is rung, villagers within a distance of 32 blocks run into their houses immediately. When a raid's first wave appears, in Java Edition, at least one villager rushes to ring the bell in the center of the village (if they are close enough) to warn the other villagers of an incoming raid before going into their house. In Bedrock Edition, bells in the corresponding village ring automatically at the start of a raid, warning villagers to return to their houses. Additionally, in Java Edition, if a bell is rung and there is a raid mob within a 32 block spherical range, the Glowing effect is applied to all raid mobs within 48 blocks, and  particles appear. It produces a resonating sound once this process is complete. The raid mobs don't have to be actively participating in a raid to receive the Glowing effect: the effect applies to illagers in woodland mansions, or witches that naturally spawns in the Overworld.\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins admire bells as golden items. However, breaking a bell does not aggravate them.[1]\n\n",

It always stays lit, despite containing no items.\n\nUsage\n    Furnaces cannot be pushed by pistons in Java Edition.\n\n  Smelting\n    The main purpose of a furnace is smelting. Its interface can be opened by pressing the use item button on it. A fuel source (up to one stack of fuel items) is placed in the lower slot, and the items (up to one stack) to be smelted are placed in the upper slot. A furnace smelts items at a speed of one item every 200 game ticks (10 seconds) or six items per minute. The number of items that a fuel source can smelt depends on the type of fuel. As soon as smelting begins, the fuel slot is decremented immediately and that unit of fuel begins burning. The fuel continues burning until it is consumed, regardless of whether the upper slot has any items remaining to smelt. For example, a piece of coal burns for 80 seconds and can smelt eight items, but if only one item is smelted (or if the item is pulled out before smelting is complete), the coal still continues burning for the full 80 seconds, wasting seven items worth of smelting. After it burns out, no additional fuel is decremented from the fuel slot if the upper slot is empty. If the fuel slot is empty and the burning fuel is consumed before an item completes smelting, the smelting stops, the smelted item is unchanged, and smelting must be restarted with new fuel.\n\n    Smelting Recipe\n\n    \"\"\n\n\n  Light source\n    Furnaces emit a light level of 13 when active, as well as smoke and flame particles.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Blast Furnace,Iron Ingot + Furnace + Smooth Stone,\"[['Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot', 'Iron Ingot'], ['Iron Ingot', '', 'Iron Ingot'], ['Smooth Stone', 'Smooth Stone', 'Smooth Stone']]\"\n\n    Minecart with Furnace,Furnace + Minecart,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Minecart', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n    Smoker,Any Log or Stem or Any Stripped Log or Stem or Any Wood or Hyphae or Any Stripped Wood or Hyphae + Furnace,\"[[None, 'Oak Log', None], ['Oak Log', '', 'Oak Log'], [None, 'Oak Log', None]]\"\n\n\n  Custom name\n    By default, the GUI of a furnace is labeled \"Furnace\", but this name can be customized by naming it in an anvil before placing it, or by changing the CustomName tag using the /data command\u200c[Java Edition  only].\n\n  Lock\n    In Java Edition, a furnace can be \"locked\" by setting its Lock tag using the /data command. If a furnace's Lock tag is not blank, the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a furnace at (0,64,0) so that the furnace cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Furnace Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Furnace Key\"}.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    A furnace can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

There are approximately 1,850 dirt blocks per chunk in plains, forest, snowy plains, jungle, and windswept hills biomes. In villages, dirt generates naturally as part of several different structures. In woodland mansions, dirt generates in several types of rooms. Four blocks of dirt also generates as part of each ancient city and they also generate in trail ruins. Dirt can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. Dirt attempts to generate 7 times per chunk in blobs of size 0-160 at Y=0\u2014160, in all biomes. It can replace stone, granite, andesite, diorite, polished granite\u200c[BE  only], polished andesite\u200c[BE  only], polished diorite\u200c[BE  only], tuff\u200c[JE  only], and deepslate\u200c[JE  only].\n\n  Mob loot\n    An enderman drops a dirt block upon death, if holding one.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Farmland turns into dirt if either a mob jumps on it, a solid block is placed over it, or if nothing is planted on it and it is not within four blocks of water. Dirt paths immediately turns into dirt if a solid block is placed over it. Coarse dirt can be tilled with a hoe to become dirt. Tilling rooted dirt with a hoe turns it into normal dirt, and yields a hanging roots item. Grass blocks and mycelium can die under various circumstances. When they die, they turn into dirt.\n\n  Renewability\n    By tilling coarse dirt, the player can convert gravel into dirt. Two blocks each of gravel and dirt become four blocks of coarse dirt, which can then be placed and tilled. Since gravel is renewable through bartering with piglins, this makes a renewable source of dirt. Another way to obtain renewable dirt makes use of moss blocks. Azalea converts the moss block below it into rooted dirt when grown into a tree. In Java Edition, Large spruce trees convert up to about 100 moss blocks into podzol when grown. Since moss can be converted from stone using bone meal, and stone can be renewably generated with water and lava, dirt can be renewably created as long as there is access to water, lava and moss blocks. A third way to obtain renewable dirt is by buying podzol or rooted dirt from wandering traders. However, only 18 blocks of podzol or 10 blocks of rooted dirt can be purchased from each trader, so this method cannot be performed on a large scale.\n\nUsage\n    Dirt's primary use is for farming, but it can also be used as a highly available building block.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Coarse Dirt,Dirt + Gravel,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Gravel', None], ['Gravel', '', None]]\"\n\n\n  Farming\n    Dirt has the ability to grow saplings, sugar cane, mushrooms, sweet berries, and bamboo, which can be planted directly in dirt under appropriate conditions. Using a hoe on dirt turns it into farmland, enabling wheat seeds, pumpkin seeds, melon seeds, potatoes, carrots, beetroot seeds, pitcher pods, and torchflower seeds to be planted on it.\n\n  Dirt path\n    Using a shovel on dirt turns it into a dirt path.\n\n  Grass and mycelium spreading\n    When a dirt block is adjacent to a grass block and is exposed to a light level of at least 4, it is eventually converted into a grass block at random intervals. Mycelium spreads in a similar fashion, but requires a light level of at least 9.\n\n  Mud\n    Using a water bottle, splash water bottle or lingering water bottle will convert the dirt into mud.\n\n",

Expert-level shepherd villagers have a 2\u20447 chance of offering the same trade.\u200c[Java Edition  only] In Bedrock Edition, expert-level cartographer and shepherd villagers both offer to sell one of 16 blank banners for 3 emeralds as part of their trades.\n\nUsage\n    There are 16 colored blank banners, and numerous patterns each available in each of the 16 colors. A banner can feature up to 6 different patterns. The top layer of a banner (or the last pattern added) can be washed off by using it on a cauldron containing water. Banners, much like signs, can be placed both on the ground facing in any direction, or on a wall. They gently sway as if affected by a breeze, regardless of dimension or location. Banners have no collision mask as they are completely non-solid, so entities can move through them. Other blocks (including other banners) can be placed on any edge of a banner's hitbox, which is only one block high despite the banner appearing as two blocks tall. This makes it possible to overlap another solid block on the top half of a banner for floor banners, or the bottom half of wall banners. When a banner is placed on the side of a block, its position is set by the top block, and it is possible to place it so it appears half buried. Banners can also be placed in item frames, where they simply appear as their item model. Water and lava flow around banners. In Bedrock Edition, banners can be waterlogged. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to banners as if the banners were flammable, but the banners do not burn (and cannot be burned by other methods). Banners also cannot be moved by pistons. If a banner is renamed on an anvil, it retains its name when a pattern is added, but not when a pattern is removed.\n\n  Helmet\n    While a banner cannot be equipped in the head slot in Survival mode, equipping it using commands causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how raid captains wear banners\u200c[JE  only].\n\n  Chestplate\n    While a banner cannot be equipped in the chestplate slot in Survival mode, equipping it using NBT editors causes it to appear on top of the player. This is how raid captains wear banners\u200c[BE & edu  only].\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Shields can have patterns applied to them using banners. The shield pattern has a smaller resolution than the banner pattern, causing them to look different or offset. Banners that have more than six patterns, such as Ominous Banners or banners obtained through inventory editors, will be reduced to six patterns on the shield.\n\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Shield + Matching Banner or Ominous Banner,\"[[None, None, None], ['Shield', 'White Banner', None], [None, None, None]]\",Applies the banner pattern to the shield. The banner is consumed. The shield must have no pre-existing patterns. Does not change existing durability or enchantments on the shield.\n\n\n  Copying\n    Banners can be copied with a blank banner to make multiple identical banners. Banners with more than 6 patterns applied using commands cannot be copied in this manner.\n\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Matching Banner,\"[[None, None, None], ['White Banner', 'White Banner', None], [None, None, None]]\",\"Copies pattern; both banners must have the same base color, and the one having a pattern copied onto it must have no preexisting pattern.\"\n\n\n  Map marker\n    In Java Edition, using on a standing banner with a map selected places a marker of the banner's position on the selected map, and using on the banner again removes the marker. Note that wall banners cannot serve as map markers. The marker has the same color as the banner's base without decorations. The marker is removed if the banner is destroyed unless the map is locked using a cartography table. If the banner is renamed, the name appears below the marker.\n\n  Patterns\n    A banner may have up to six layers of patterns, which are overlaid with the last-crafted on top. A banner can have up to 16 layers of patterns with the use of commands. The total number of unique banners is approximately 2.3\u00d71016 (or 23 quadrillion). Any color banner can be used; the pattern overlays the color. In Java Edition, a loom is used to make patterns. However, in Bedrock Edition, the patterns can be made in a loom or a crafting table. A banner can have more than six layers of patterns through the commands /give, /setblock or /fill. This only works in Java Edition, as Bedrock Edition doesn't have any NBT commands. Here is an example of a mining banner with seven different patterns. There is specific codes for the colors and patterns that you have to input. /give @p white_banner{display:{Name:\"\\\"Mining Industries Banner\\\"\"},BlockEntityTag:{Patterns:[{Pattern:\"cr\",Color:15},{Pattern:\"bs\",Color:15},{Pattern:\"sc\",Color:12},{Pattern:\"ms\",Color:0},{Pattern:\"hh\",Color:15},{Pattern:\"bo\",Color:15},{Pattern:\"tts\",Color:8}]}} 1\n\n  Renaming\n    In Java Edition, a banner can be given a custom name that remains as the banner is placed and retrieved. The player can use an anvil to rename the banner item, or may change the CustomName tag using the /data command on the banner block.\n\n  Fuel\n    Banners can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per banner.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Banners can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n",

By fertilizing one lichen with bone meal, it is possible to cover the sides and the top of an adjacent block, but not the back. Otherwise, glow lichen does not spread naturally.\n\nUsage\n  Light\n    Glow lichen emits a light level of 7.\n\n  Placement\n    Multiple glow lichens can be placed in the area of one solid block, such as covering three sides of a corner. When such glow lichens are mined, all glow lichens occupying the same block are also mined. Mining with shears causes all glow lichens in the block to drop. Glow lichens cannot be broken by flowing water or lava,[1][2] similar to signs. Therefore, they may be used to control the flow of these fluids.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a glow lichen into a composter has a 50% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n",

Stonecutting blocks of copper gives four times more products than typical for stone.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Copper Ingot,Block of Copper or Waxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\",\n\n    Unwaxed Copper Bulb,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper + Blaze Rod + Redstone Dust,\"[[None, '', None], ['', 'Blaze Rod', ''], [None, 'Redstone Dust', None]]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Unwaxed Copper Door,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,\"[['', '', None], ['', '', None], ['', '', None]]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Unwaxed Copper Grate,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, '', None], ['', None, ''], [None, '', None]]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Unwaxed Copper Trapdoor,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, None, None], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Unwaxed Cut Copper,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, None, None], ['', '', None], ['', '', None]]\",\n\n    Waxed Copper Bulb,Matching Waxed Block of Copper + Blaze Rod + Redstone Dust,\"[[None, 'Waxed Block of Copper', None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Blaze Rod', 'Waxed Block of Copper'], [None, 'Redstone Dust', None]]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Waxed Copper Door,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,\"[['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', None]]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Waxed Copper Grate,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, 'Waxed Block of Copper', None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', None, 'Waxed Block of Copper'], [None, 'Waxed Block of Copper', None]]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Waxed Copper Trapdoor,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, None, None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper'], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper']]\",\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Waxed Cut Copper,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,\"[[None, None, None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', None], ['Waxed Block of Copper', 'Waxed Block of Copper', None]]\",\n\n\n  Stonecutting\n    Name,Ingredients,Cutting recipe,Description\n\n    Unwaxed Cut Copper,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\n\n    Unwaxed Cut Copper Slab,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,8 8 8 8,\n\n    Unwaxed Cut Copper Stairs,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\n\n    Unwaxed Chiseled Copper,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Unwaxed Copper Grate,Matching Unwaxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Waxed Cut Copper,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\n\n    Waxed Cut Copper Slab,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,8 8 8 8,\n\n    Waxed Cut Copper Stairs,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\n\n    Waxed Chiseled Copper,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n    Waxed Copper Grate,Matching Waxed Block of Copper,4 4 4 4,\u200c [ upcoming: JE 1.21 & BE 1.21.0 ]\n\n\n  Oxidation\n    Non-waxed copper blocks have four stages of oxidation (including the initial normal state).

In the last stage (oxidized copper), the block is teal with several green spots.\n\n",

            "paragraphs": [
                {
                    "context": "Overview\n    Bedrock is an indestructible block found in all three dimensions. It cannot be obtained as an item in Survival.\n\nObtaining\n    Bedrock can be obtained from the Creative inventory, or using commands.\n\n  Breaking\n    Bedrock cannot normally be broken in Survival mode with any tool. It can only be broken by hand in the oneblockatatime snapshot and has a hardness value of 600. However, it can be broken using glitches involving a piston, but it does not drop as an item.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Bedrock comprises the five bottom-most layers of the Overworld in a rough pattern, although the top four layers are predominantly flat bedrock with only rare gaps, rendering the lowest, completely flat fifth layer (at Y=-64) mostly inaccessible. In the Nether, bedrock comprises both the top and bottom four layers in a rough pattern. In both Java and Bedrock Editions, the patterns of bedrock are consistent in the Nether. At the top of the Nether, bedrock prevents the player from ascending above Y=127 without exploiting glitches, although in Java Edition the build limit extends to Y=255 in the Nether, meaning it is possible to build there. This space, known as the \"Nether ceiling\", consists entirely of flat bedrock and the occasional mushrooms. No mobs spawn here, as nothing can spawn on bedrock, although mobs can spawn on valid blocks placed by a player. In the End, a single block of bedrock generates on top of each obsidian pillar, each topped with an end crystal. The bedrock remains after the destruction of the crystal (because it is indestructible), and is lit on fire indefinitely. Bedrock additionally comprises part of the exit portal at the center of the central island. Unlike in other dimensions, there is no bedrock floor at the bottom of the End, meaning it is possible to fall into the void without exploiting glitches. An unlimited number of end gateways generate randomly across the outer End islands, each consisting of 12 blocks of bedrock.\n\n  Post-generation\n    If the bedrock that makes up the exit portal is removed by any means, it regenerates when the ender dragon is defeated or re-summoned. An end gateway is generated on the central End island upon the death of each ender dragon, which is mostly made of bedrock. A total of 20 of these gateways generate in a circle centered on the exit portal in set positions. A corresponding end gateway is generated in the inner edge of the outer islands after an end gateway on the central island is activated for the first time.\n\nUsage\n    Bedrock generates at the bottom of the Overworld and the Nether in order to prevent players from falling into the void. The bedrock ceiling in the Nether was intended to prevent players from accessing the Nether ceiling, which was meant to be an empty out-of-bounds area where players cannot build. This remains true in Bedrock Edition. However, in Java Edition 1.2.1, the world height was doubled from 127 to 255, a change which was applied in all three dimensions, allowing players to build on the Nether ceiling. Due to the amount of players taking advantage of this change, it was decided by Mojang that this was to be treated as an intended feature.[1] Bedrock generates as part of important structures in the End, including crucial elements of the ender dragon fight, as well as the gateways and the exit portals, in order to prevent them from being broken and keep them accessible and usable. Mobs do not spawn on bedrock. Endermen are unable to place the block they are holding onto bedrock. Beacons treat bedrock as a transparent block, meaning their beams can pass through it, allowing beacons to be used in the Nether. In the End, any fire on bedrock never extinguishes naturally, similar to netherrack.\n\n  Trapping the wither\n    Since bedrock is indestructible in Survival, it can be used against withers. Certain configurations of bedrock (Such as that found under the exit portal) can be used to securely trap withers by spawning them below the bedrock. The wither can then either be easily killed, utilized to break blocks automatically, or used to farm wither roses.\n\n  End crystal\n    Bedrock is one of the only two blocks on which end crystals can be placed, the other being obsidian. Placing an end crystal on bedrock in the End sets it on fire.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Note blocks can be placed above bedrock to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Bedrock is unable to be pushed or pulled by either of the piston variants (regular or sticky).\n\n",

Deepslate redstone ore is a variant of redstone ore that can generate in deepslate and tuff blobs.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Redstone ore must be mined with an iron pickaxe or higher to drop redstone dust. When mined, it drops 4\u20135 redstone dust. It is affected by the Fortune enchantment, dropping 4-6, 4-7, or 4-8 redstone respectively with Fortune I, II, and III (averaging at 6 redstone dust with Fortune level 3[1][2]). If mined with Silk Touch, it drops itself instead of redstone dust.\n\n    Block,Redstone Ore,Deepslate Redstone Ore\n\n    Hardness,3,4.5\n\n    Tool,iron pickaxe,iron pickaxe\n\n    Breaking time (sec) [A]\n\n    Default,15,22.5\n\n    Wooden,7.5,11.25\n\n    Stone,3.75,5.65\n\n    Iron,0.75,1.15\n\n    Diamond,0.6,0.85\n\n    Netherite,0.5,0.75\n\n    Golden,1.25,1.9\n\n\n  Natural generation\n    Redstone ore can generate in the Overworld in the form of ore blobs. Redstone ore generates in two batches per chunk. The first batch attempts to generate 4 times per chunk, in blobs of 0\u201310, evenly from levels -64 to 15. The second batch attempts to generate 8 times per chunk, in blobs of 0\u201310, from levels -63 to -32, being more common the lower the elevation. Redstone ore can replace stone, andesite, diorite, granite, polished andesite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], polished diorite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], polished granite\u200c\u200c[BE  only], tuff\u200c[JE  only], and deepslate. Any redstone ore that replaces tuff or deepslate becomes deepslate redstone ore.\n\nUsage\n  Light\n    Redstone ore produces the light level of 9 and emits bright red powered redstone particle when clicked, updated, or contacted by almost any entity (among some of the exceptions are a sneaking player, fired arrows, fired fire charges, shulkers, shulker bullets, and the ender dragon). This effect continues until the redstone ore block receives a random block tick (averaging 68.27 seconds). This effect does not actually produce redstone power, but the block changes can be detected with an observer or a block update detector. Subsequent clickings on a redstone ore block causes it to emit an extra burst of particles per click.\n\n  Smelting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Smelting recipe\n\n    Redstone Dust,Redstone Ore or Deepslate Redstone Ore + Any fuel,0.7\n\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Redstone ore can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

They cannot be placed on slabs and stairs unless those blocks are upside-down. Pots may also be placed on an upward facing trapdoor. If the trapdoor is opened, the pot will break. Flower pots are 3\u20448 of a block high and can be stepped on. It is not possible to walk from the top of a flower pot onto a full sized block without jumping.

Unlike fire, campfires do not spread under any circumstances. Campfires are lit by default when placed. Campfires can be manually lit by using or dispensing flint and steel on them, shooting it with a flaming arrow, or using or dispensing fire charges, blaze fireballs, and ghast fireballs when /gamerule mobGriefing is true. In Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be lit by using an item enchanted with fire aspect, or stepping on it while burning. Campfires can be extinguished by waterlogging it (placing water in the same block space), throwing a splash water bottle on it, or using a shovel on it. Campfires cannot be extinguished from their bottom face.\u200c[JE  only][1] In Bedrock Edition, campfires can also be extinguished by placing a water source or allowing water to flow in the space above the campfire. As with torches, rain does not extinguish campfires.[2] Using flint and steel on the side of a waterlogged or lit campfire sets the adjacent air block on fire instead. Any items cooking on a campfire always drop when the campfire block is broken.\n\n  Particles and smoke signals\n    Campfires produce smoke particles that float up around 10 blocks before disappearing. If a hay bale is placed below, the campfire becomes a signal fire and the smoke floats up 24 blocks instead. Campfire smoke particles can partially pass through a block directly above it, but do not pass through blocks more than one block directly above it. Although a trap door is thinner than a slab, a trap door can block the smoke completely, preventing the smoke from floating up. Campfires emit extra smoke particles during rain, similar to lava. Campfires also emit occasional ember particles, similar to lava.\n\n  Damage\n    Campfires damage mobs standing on top of them even if underwater (with exceptions such as shulkers, zombified piglins or guardians), but only if lit. Campfires deal 1 (although damage immunity reduces this to once every half-second) Campfires do not cause lasting burning or destroy items. Damage taken is considered fire damage and is reduced by armor (which loses durability), the Resistance potion effects, and the Protection and Fire Protection enchantments. The player can avoid being damaged at all, either by using a potion of fire resistance or wearing Frost Walker boots. Regardless of height, all blocks prevent damage done to mobs or players above campfires. The campfire deals damage only to entities occupying its block.\n\n  Cooking\n    The player can place any of the following food items on a lit campfire by using the food item on it. Up to four food items can be placed on a single campfire, which cooks the items simultaneously. Unlike other blocks that can cook food, campfires do not require any kind of fuel to cook. On a campfire, foods produce small smoke particles, indicating they are being cooked. Food items take 30 seconds (600 ticks) to cook, compared to 10 seconds for furnaces or 5 seconds for smokers. Assuming that one uses all four slots to cook at once, the Campfire is, therefore, more efficient than furnaces (taking 10 seconds less per four items and no fuel) for cooking, but must be watched so as to pick up the food and refill it once it is done. It is slower than a smoker by about ten seconds, but its lack of fuel consumption could be seen as a worthwhile trade-off. Once finished cooking, items pop off the campfire. If the campfire is extinguished while cooking food, the remaining cooking time quickly counts back up. Food items can be placed on an unlit campfire. Other items can be placed on campfires using external editors, mods or add-ons.\n\n  Hoppers\n    Campfires do not have an external inventory. Raw food cannot be loaded into the campfire with a hopper. A hopper placed directly underneath a campfire pulls through any items dropped into the campfire. Any drops from a mob that dies in the campfire get pulled into the hopper.\n\n  Bees\n    Placing a campfire under a beehive or bee nest allows players to harvest honey bottles or honeycomb without provoking the bees.\nThere must be unobstructed air between the campfire and the beehive or bee nest. Carpets are an exception.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Light source\n    Standard lit campfires emit a light level of 15. Like most other sources of light, campfires melt nearby snow and ice.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Campfires can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    In Bedrock Edition, pushing a campfire with a piston or sticky piston breaks it. Campfires cannot be pulled by sticky pistons. In Java Edition, pistons do not interact with campfires. Campfires neither move nor break when pushed or pulled by pistons.\n\n",

In Java Edition, it attempts to generate 4 times per chunk in sizes of 0\u2013160, from altitudes Y=27 to Y=36 in all biomes. It can only replace netherrack. In Bedrock Edition, it attempts to generate 9 times per chunk in sizes of 0\u2013106, from altitudes Y=23 to Y=36 in all biomes. It can replace netherrack and blackstone. Magma blocks generate as part of deltas in basalt deltas biomes, replacing some of the lava.

Walking into the side of a magma block doesn't cause damage. Magma blocks do not destroy items. Damage from magma blocks does not reduce durability in netherite armor. Because magma blocks deal fire damage, it can be reduced by armor, the Resistance effect, and Protection/Fire Protection enchantments, and can be completely negated by the Fire Resistance effect.  Unlike other sources of fire damage, sneaking and the Frost Walker enchantment can also grant immunity to damage from magma blocks. Any mobs immune to fire damage cannot take damage from magma blocks. However, a few mobs like shulkers cannot take magma block damage despite not having natural immunity to fire. Magma blocks do not set mobs or players on fire, and thus do not cook the animals that it kills. Blocks that are the height of a trapdoor or lower (such as snow layers, carpets, repeaters, or comparators) do not prevent a magma block from damaging mobs and players above it.[1][2] There are a few specific death messages associate with magma blocks. If a player or named pet is killed simply from standing on the block, the death message displayed in the chat is: \"[player] discovered the floor was lava\". If a player or named pet was attacked and knocked back to their death onto magma blocks, the message is: \"[player] walked into danger zone due to [player/mob]\".\n\n  Behavior\n    Magma blocks emit a light level of 3. They do not melt ice or snow. Magma blocks emit smoke particles under rainfall, much like lava. Making walls out of magma blocks prevents spiders from climbing them.\u200c[BE  only] Mobs avoid magma blocks that are in the way. Most mobs do not spawn on magma blocks (exceptions are magma cubes, zombified piglin, ghasts, and squid). When a magma block's top is set on fire, the fire burns indefinitely, similar to netherrack.\n\n  Bubble columns\n    When a water source is directly above a magma block, a whirlpool bubble column is created, going down from the highest source block. Anything encountering the bubble column is pulled down, including items, boats, players, and mobs. A player can restore breath underwater by entering a magma block's bubble column.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Magma blocks can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

The normal prismarine is uniquely useful for decoration as it has an animated texture. The cracks in prismarine slowly cycle in color through light blue, green, purple, and dark blue. The full animation for the prismarine texture changes color 22 times in an irregular sequence before the whole pattern repeats; this takes 5 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\n  Conduit power\n    Prismarine can be used to activate a conduit by building a structure around it. By doing this, the conduit emits the \"Conduit Power\" effect in a certain radius, depending on how many blocks are used to power it. Sea lanterns can also be used for this purpose.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Prismarine Slab,Prismarine,\"[[None, None, None], [None, None, None], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n    Prismarine Stairs,Prismarine,\"[['', None, None], ['', '', None], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n    Prismarine Wall,Prismarine,\"[[None, None, None], ['', '', ''], ['', '', '']]\"\n\n    Tide Armor Trim Smithing Template,Diamond + Tide Armor Trim + Prismarine,\"[['Diamond', 'Smithing Template', 'Diamond'], ['Diamond', '', 'Diamond'], ['Diamond', 'Diamond', 'Diamond']]\"\n\n\n  Stonecutting\n    Ingredients,Cutting recipe\n\n    Prismarine,2\n\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Prismarine can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sound.\n\n",

It is the fuel with the highest number of operations per fuel below 64 items. The highest number of items that can be smelted without any refills or hoppers and without loss of fuel is 60 items (3 dried kelp blocks). Crafting a dried kelp block first requires smelting 9 pieces of kelp, so its net fuel value is only 11 items. However, using a different fuel source to smelt pieces of kelp that are then crafted into dried kelp blocks, the number of operations per fuel is effectively increased. If a lava bucket were used to smelt 100 pieces of kelp that were then crafted into 11 dried kelp blocks, which can then smelt a total of 220 items, giving the lava bucket a net increase of 20 items smelted.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Dried Kelp,Dried Kelp Block,\"[[None, None, None], [None, '', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Composting\n    Dried kelp blocks have a 50% chance of increasing the compost level in a composter by 1. Composting a dried kelp block instead of 9 dried kelps is less efficient. For example, 100 dried kelp blocks would yield 7 1\u20447 bone meal on average. Crafting them into 900 dried kelp before composting would instead yield 38 4\u20447 bone meals on average.\n\n  Trading\n    Expert-level butcher villagers buy 10 dried kelp blocks for an emerald.\n\n",

Enchantments on the bow do not affect the resulting dispenser.\n\n\nUsage\n    A dispenser can be used as a container and as a redstone component that dispenses items when activated, with results varying based on the item dispensed. For example, the trap in a jungle pyramid incorporates arrows inside a dispenser, which shoots the arrows when activated. To place a dispenser, use it while pointing at a surface adjacent to the space it should occupy. A dispenser can be placed so that its output faces in any direction, including up or down. When placed, a dispenser faces the location of the player placing it. A dispenser cannot be moved by pistons.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Container\n    A dispenser has 9 slots of inventory space. To open the dispenser GUI, use the Use Item control. To move items between the dispenser inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the dispenser GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the dispenser GUI, use the Esc control. By default, the GUI of a dispenser is labeled \"Dispenser\". A dispenser's GUI label can be changed by naming the dispenser in an anvil before placing it, or by using the data command\u200c[Java Edition  only]. For example, to label a dispenser at (0,64,0) \"My Dispenser\", use data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"My Dispenser\"'}. A dispenser can be \"locked\" by setting the dispenser's Lock tag. If a dispenser's Lock tag is not blank, the dispenser cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. A dispenser's Lock tag can be set or unset with the data command. For example, to lock a dispenser at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"My Key\" can access the dispenser, use data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"My Key\"}.\n\n  Redstone component\n    A dispenser can be used to dispense its contents randomly. Activation A dispenser is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by: Some of these methods can activate a dispenser (in the sense of triggering an action) without powering the dispenser (in the sense of whether the dispenser can power adjacent redstone dust, etc.). In addition to the methods above, a dispenser can also be activated by quasi-connectivity.\u200c[Java Edition  only] A dispenser becomes activated if one of the methods above would activate a mechanism component in the block above the dispenser, even if there is no mechanism component there (even if the block above the dispenser is air or a transparent block), but only when the dispenser receives a block update (including a redstone update within two blocks of the dispenser). A dispenser does not activate if it has been less than 1 redstone tick (2 game ticks, or 0.1 seconds barring lag) since its last activation ended. Behavior When activated, a dispenser waits for 2 redstone ticks (4 game ticks, or 0.2 seconds barring lag) and then ejects one item. The dispenser does not continue to eject items while activated; ejection occurs only on the initial activation (the rising edge of an input signal). To eject multiple items, repeatedly activate the dispenser with a clock circuit. If the clock runs at faster than 5\u00a0Hz (more than 5 redstone pulses a second), the dispenser fires once and then locks in the \"on\" position. If multiple slots are occupied by items, a random occupied slot is chosen for ejection. The slot is chosen when an item is ejected, not when the dispenser is initially activated; thus it is possible to move items into or out of a dispenser between its activation and item dispensing. The effects of being activated vary with the type of ejected item. Most items are thrown in the direction the dispenser is facing as if a player had used the Drop Item control. (Unlike a dropper, a dispenser can't feed another container.)  Other items behave differently when dispensed, as described in the table below.  In general, a dispenser cannot place blocks into the world; the exceptions are shulker boxes, powder snow,\u200c[Java Edition  only] and certain cases where the placed block would do something unusual.  There are also a couple of special cases where an empty bottle or bucket can collect liquids from the world. When dispensing an item that has durability would cause the item to be used, such as with flint and steel and shears, the item's durability decreases.\n\n    Dispenser Behavior\n\n    Item,Effect\n\n    Armor Elytra,\"Equips on a player , armor stand , skeleton , wither skeleton , stray , zombie , husk , pillager , drowned , vindicator , villager , piglin or zombified piglin within the block the dispenser is facing with empty appropriate armor slot (any armor, made from any material).\"\n\n    Armor Stand,Placed as an entity in the block the dispenser is facing.\u200c [ Java Edition only ] [1]\n\n    Arrow Spectral Arrow Tipped Arrow,Fired in the direction the dispenser is facing.\n\n    Boat Boat with Chest,\"Placed as an entity (i.e., a right-clickable vehicle) in the block the dispenser is facing, if the dispenser is facing the water or an empty block above water \u2014 otherwise dropped.

Breaking a cracked turtle egg with a Silk Touch tool resets the growth stage when the egg is placed on a different block.\n\n    Block,Turtle Egg\n\n    Hardness,0.5\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.75\n\n\n  Post-generation\n    After two turtles are bred with seagrass, one of them travels back to its home beach, digs in the sand, and lays an egg block with 1\u20134 eggs after several seconds. See hatching mechanics below.\n\nTrampling\n    Turtle eggs can be trampled by living entities (players, mobs, livestock, etc.) that fall onto or stand on top of them. Eggs in a multi-egg block are trampled one at a time until no eggs remain. End crystals can also break turtle eggs if they explode. Eggs can be trampled by a crouch-walking (or \"sneaking\") player. Though eggs cannot be trampled by non-living entities like arrows, they can be trampled by armor stands. When a falling block such as an anvil or sand block is dropped onto an egg, the falling block is dropped and turned into an item leaving the egg unharmed. Zombies and their variants (husks, drowned, zombie villager and zombified piglins) seek out and trample turtle eggs that have 2 blocks of air above them unless /gamerule mobGriefing is false. The range of detection is a 47\u00d77\u00d747\u200c[JE  only] or 11\u00d75\u00d711\u200c[BE  only] box centered on the block the mob is standing on. When a player in Survival or Adventure Game-mode is nearby (also includes iron golems and villagers), the zombie prefers to attack the player rather than trampling the turtle egg. Other than zombies and their variants, mobs do not seek out turtle eggs to trample them, but still may break them by accident. An entity falling onto an egg has a 1\u20443 chance of trampling the egg and an entity standing on top of an egg has a 1\u2044100 chance per tick of trampling the egg. Turtles cannot break turtle eggs, even when they are on top of them.\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Up to 4 turtle eggs can be placed in one block and slowly hatch into turtles. Though turtle eggs can be placed on any block, they only hatch on sand blocks. When adding more eggs to an existing block, they will retain their hatching progress. Turtle eggs do not require a supporting block below and unlike dragon eggs are not affected by gravity. Eggs are also capable of supporting lanterns hanging under them.[2]\n\n  Hatching\n    Turtle eggs hatch on sand and red sand. Eggs crack over time and hatch after cracking three times. Eggs hatch significantly faster at nighttime. Turtle eggs have a very low chance of cracking during random ticks during the day (1/500 chance). However, they are much more likely to crack during random ticks between 21600 and 22550 ticks in-game time (3:36 am and 4:33 am). This is a roughly 48-second window for the player. About 95% of eggs crack or hatch during this night-time window. On average, an egg hatches in 4-5 nights. 90% of eggs hatch in 7 nights or less.[3] When a multi-egg block hatches, all eggs hatch simultaneously. Eggs do not progress toward hatching if the player is not within 128 blocks of horizontal distance of the egg. This is due to the egg's chunk not receiving random ticks.\n\n",

Only blocks with block states hanging=false or with age=4 drop themselves.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Hanging mangrove propagules generate under leaf blocks of mangrove trees that spawn in mangrove swamps.\n\n  Trading\n    A mangrove propagule is sold by the wandering trader for 5 emeralds.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Applying bone meal to a block of mangrove leaves with a space underneath produces a hanging mangrove propagule with age=0.\n\nUsage\n  Growing trees\n    A hanging mangrove propagule cannot grow into a tree. Like saplings, mangrove propagules can grow only if a player is within a certain radius, even in loaded chunks. Also as with saplings, mangrove propagules have two growth stages (with no visible difference between them) before growing into trees. When a tree is to be grown, a height is chosen and then the ground and space are checked; if the ground is bad or there is not space for the chosen height, the tree does not grow. Bone meal can be used to speed up the growth of the sapling, even to grow the tree without sufficient light. Mangrove propagules can be placed all variants of dirt (except dirt paths) or moss blocks, as well as on mud. it requires a light level of at least 9. A mangrove also requires at least 6 empty spaces above the propagule. The height of the tree depends on how far the roots can spread horizontally. The roots can spread up to 5 blocks away from the propagule. It requires at least one solid block within the 9\u00d79\u00d79 cube directly underneath and centered on the sapling outside the column where the sapling is, and solid blocks for the bottoms of the roots to land on within 11 blocks below the sapling in a 9\u00d79 area. The farther the solid blocks are below the sapling, the more attempts it takes to generate a suitable tree shape. Mud does not count as a solid block. Dirt blocks in the space above the propagule are an exception. Dirt blocks do not stop the tree from growing. The dirt remains in place and the rest of the tree generates normally around it (it is possible to grow a tree that contains only one log block at the original sapling location, with a column of dirt above where the rest of the trunk should be and leaves spreading out from it). In Java Edition, all types of log block and wood block and their stripped versions are also treated like dirt blocks (they don't stop growth). In Bedrock Edition, log and wood blocks are treated like other block types and stop the tree from growing if they are above it. When a propagule on a grass block grows into a tree, the grass block becomes a dirt block.\n\n  Bees\n    Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with mangrove propagules, increasing the honey level in beehives and bee nests by 1.\n\n  Breeding\n    Mangrove propagules can be fed to bees for breeding, and reduce the remaining growth duration of baby bees by 10%. Bees also follow a player holding a mangrove propagule.\n\n  Decoration\n    Mangrove propagules can be placed in a flower pot.\n\n  Fuel\n    Mangrove propagules can be used as a fuel in furnaces, smelting 0.5 items per sapling.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a mangrove propagule into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1. A stack of saplings yields an average of 2.74 bonemeal.\n\n",

Lightning diverted by a lightning rod can still start fires nearby (quickly extinguished on non-flammable blocks or by rain) and inflicts lightning damage on mobs within a 6\u00d712\u00d76 box centered 4 blocks above the bottom center of the lightning rod block (that is extending 2 below and 9 above). Adjacent blocks can ignite even if the lightning rod is mounted on a non-flammable block.\n\n",

Eating a carrot restores 3 () hunger and 3.6 hunger saturation.\n\n  Farming\n    Carrots can be farmed and harvested on farmland. Planted carrots take 8 stages to grow, and go through 4 visually distinct stages. Planted carrots require a light level of 9 or greater to continue growing. If the light level is 7 or below, the crops instantly un-plant themselves (\"pop off\"). It is not possible to plant carrots if the light level is too low. Crops grow faster if the farmland they are planted in is hydrated. Using bone meal on crops also increases the speed of growth by randomly increasing their growth stage by 2 to 5. Crops break if pushed by a piston or if their supporting farmland breaks or turns to dirt (i.e. by being trampled), dropping their usual drops. If /gamerule mobGriefing is true, rabbits will find mature carrot crops\u200c[Java Edition  only] / carrot crops with growth stage greater than 1\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]. This reduces the growth stages by one, removing the crop completely when the growth stage reaches 0.\n\n  Breeding\n    Carrots can also be used to breed and attract pigs and rabbits. Villagers can pick up carrot items to become willing, which allow them to breed. Villagers require 12 carrots to become willing.\n\n  Trading\n    Novice-level Farmer villagers have a 25% (1\u20444)\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] or 40% (2\u20445)\u200c[Java Edition  only] chance to buy 22 carrots for an emerald.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Carrot on a Stick,Fishing Rod or Damaged Fishing Rod + Carrot,\"[[None, None, None], [None, 'Fishing Rod', None], [None, None, '']]\",The fishing rod must be diagonally above the carrot to craft the carrot on a stick.\n\n    Golden Carrot,Gold Nugget + Carrot,\"[['Gold Nugget', 'Gold Nugget', 'Gold Nugget'], ['Gold Nugget', '', 'Gold Nugget'], ['Gold Nugget', 'Gold Nugget', 'Gold Nugget']]\",\n\n    Rabbit Stew,Cooked Rabbit + Carrot + Baked Potato + Any Mushroom + Bowl,\"[[None, 'Cooked Rabbit', None], ['', 'Baked Potato', 'Red Mushroom'], [None, 'Bowl', None]]\",\n\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a carrot into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n",

They require only grass blocks with air above (clear of any plants such as flowers or grass), and can generate regardless whether that grass block has a layer of snow cover. Practically speaking, this means that the occurrence of pumpkins in stony or sandy biomes, or in grassy biomes with few clear grass blocks, is comparatively rare. Each chunk has a 1\u204432 chance to generate a pumpkin patch, making naturally-generated pumpkins rarer than diamond ore.

Planted pumpkin seeds grow a central stem that, after maturing, generates pumpkins randomly on adjacent vacant dirt-based blocks (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots). If a pumpkin is harvested without also cutting the central stalk, another pumpkin generates afterward without requiring replanting or waiting for the stalk to mature again. If a carved pumpkin is desired, simply use the shears on the pumpkin on the ground, and then harvest it as normal. Pumpkin stems take around 10 to 30 minutes to fully develop. They require a light level of 9 or higher to grow. Bone meal can be used on pumpkin stems to become fully-grown, but this does not produce a pumpkin immediately.\n\n  Trading\n    Apprentice-level Farmer villagers buy 6 pumpkins for an emerald as part of their trades.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] Apprentice-level Farmer villagers have a 2\u20443 chance to buy 6 pumpkins for one emerald.\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a pumpkin or carved pumpkin into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Pumpkins can be placed under note blocks to produce didgeridoo sounds.

                    "context": "Overview\n    Water is a fluid that naturally generates abundantly in the Overworld.\n\nObtaining\n    Water can be collected by using a bucket on a water source block or a full water cauldron, creating a water bucket. In Java Edition, water does not have a direct item form, but in Bedrock Edition it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing or add-ons.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Water naturally generates in the Overworld to form oceans, rivers and springs. The water level is at layer 63 near oceans and rivers, but changes depending on location due to the aquifer system, filling some carvers, noise caves and canyons with water at different levels. Water also generates as small puddles on the floor next to dripstone clusters, and as clay pools on the floor of lush caves. Water also generates in villages, desert wells, strongholds, woodland mansions, ancient cities and ocean monuments. Water never generates in the Nether and instantly disappears if placed there with a water bucket. However, water can exist in the Nether in a cauldron. Water can also be placed in the Nether using commands such as /setblock and /fill. Although it does not naturally generate there, water can be placed and function normally in the End. In Bedrock Edition, water also generates as part of ocean ruins with loot chests, but only two water blocks generate: These water blocks generate even if the ruin is located on the surface.[1] This is not the case in Java Edition; if an underwater ruin generates on the surface, no water generates.[2] This also happens with shipwrecks. Water spends most of its time as stationary, rather than flowing \u2013 regardless of its level, or whether it contains a current downward or to the side. When specifically triggered by a block update, water changes to 'flowing', updates its level, then changes back to stationary. Water springs are generated as flowing, and oceans, and rivers are generated as stationary. This happens before most types of generated structure are created, and the main cause of water \"glitches\" is that generated structures do not trigger a block update to let water flow into them.\n\nUsage\n  Appearance\n    Water uses a translucent animated texture that is tinted differently in different biomes. In Java Edition, water in cauldrons is completely opaque.[3] Unlike other translucent blocks such as ice, stained glass and tinted glass, water shows the opposite sides of its external planes when viewed from within and from outside.[4] However, it applies only to the top plane and four side planes; the bottom face is always unseen from above.[5]\n\n  Swimming\n    The button for swimming is the same as the button for jumping; non-swimming players and mobs sink slowly in water. Holding the swim button raises the player through the water, and when the surface is reached, the player bobs up and down. The crouch button can be used to sink faster. The sprint button can be used to put the player in \"swim mode\" when the player is completely submerged in water. When in swim mode, the player is horizontal and one block high. The player has an arm-waving animation when viewed in third person or by other players. Swimming in water is considerably slower against currents (see Current below), but faster when going with the current. Most mobs that can stand can also swim any time they are in water, except for iron golems, piglins, hoglins, striders, piglin brutes and undead mobs. This can lead to drowning if the water is falling from above. Water of any depth prevents any entity, including the player, from sustaining falling damage if they fall into it, regardless of the distance fallen. Being inside of water also imparts a fog effect, tinted accordingly.\n\n  Spreading\n    Water spreads horizontally and downward into nearby air blocks. Water can spread downward infinitely until stopped by a block, and 7 blocks horizontally from a source block on a flat surface. Water spreads at a rate of 1 block every 5 game ticks, or 4 blocks per second. When spreading horizontally, a weight is assigned to every direction water can flow. For each direction, this weight is initially set to 1000. Then, for every adjacent block it can flow into it tries to find a way down that is reachable in four or fewer blocks from the block it wants to flow to. When found, the flow weight for that direction is set to the shortest path distance to the way down. Finally, water spreads in the directions with the lowest flow weight. Spreading water extinguishes fire and washes away certain types of items or placed blocks, causing them to drop as items and then carrying them along in the flow until the edge of the spread. Affected items include plants (except trees), snow, torches, carpets, redstone dust and some other redstone components, cobweb, end rods, heads, and flower pots.\n\n    ,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,,7,6,7,,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,7,6,5,6,7,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,7,6,5,4,5,6,7,,,,\n\n    ,,,7,6,5,4,3,4,5,6,7,,,\n\n    ,,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,,\n\n    ,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,\n\n    7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7\n\n    ,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,\n\n    ,,7,6,5,4,3,2,3,4,5,6,7,,\n\n    ,,,7,6,5,4,3,4,5,6,7,,,\n\n    ,,,,7,6,5,4,5,6,7,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,7,6,5,6,7,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,,7,6,7,,,,,,\n\n    ,,,,,,,7,,,,,,,\n\n\n    Range,Height in blocks\n\n    1,block,1\n\n    2,blocks,0.75-1\n\n    3,blocks,0.625-0.75\n\n    4,blocks,0.5-0.625\n\n    5,blocks,0.375-0.5\n\n    6,blocks,0.25-0.375\n\n    7,blocks,0.125-0.25\n\n\n  Source blocks\n     A water source block is created from a flowing block that is horizontally adjacent to two or more other source blocks, and sitting on top of a solid block or another water source block. This allows water spawners to exist, in which a new source block immediately forms in the space left by removing a source block with a bucket. Pools of still water can be created by placing water source blocks in a confined area. Water spawners can be constructed by arranging for two source blocks to flow into a third block. Each of the examples below require two source blocks, each on opposite ends of the hole, to create a renewable water source block in between. While water source blocks only generate adjacent to solid blocks, they do not require a solid block to support them. Removing all adjacent blocks to a water source block only causes it to remain floating in the air. In Java Edition, the formation of new water sources blocks can be disabled when the game rule waterSourceConversion is set to false. A dispenser loaded with a filled bucket places a water source block in an empty block in front of it when activated. A dispenser loaded with an empty bucket and a water source right in front of it sucks the source into the bucket when activated. In snowy biomes, water source blocks have a chance to turn into ice if directly under the sky. Ice blocks under brighter light levels melt back into water source blocks (except in the Nether). Ice reverts to water when broken, but only if there is a solid block under it.\n\n  Current\n    The current in a water block determines both the direction it appears to flow and the direction an entity such as a player or boat is pushed from that block. Water with a current pushes players and mobs at a speed of about 1.39 meters per second, or 25 blocks every 18 seconds. Players that are in creative flying mode don\u2019t get pushed.\u200c[Java Edition  only][6] The horizontal current in a water block is based on a vector sum of the flows to and from that block from its four horizontal neighbors. For example, if a block receives water from the north and sends it both south and east, but borders a solid block on its west edge, then a south-southeast current exits from that block, because 2 southward flows (in and out) are combined with 1 eastward flow (out). Thus, 16 horizontal directions are possible. If a branch in a channel is 2 blocks wide at its entrance, then entities float into it rather than continuing in a straight line. Water blocks can create a downward current. A downward current in a water block is caused by the block below it. Most blocks that do not have a solid upper face cause downward current on above water blocks. Also, ice and falling water blocks (blocks created by spreading downward) cause downward current on the water block above. Falling water blocks have a downward current by default.\n\n  Light\n    In Bedrock Edition, every block of water reduces light by 1 extra level (in addition to the normal fading-out of light). In Java Edition, water does not cause any additional decrease for block light, but diffuses sky light, causing the light to fade with depth. Underwater visibility changes depending on the biome the player is in. The Night Vision and Conduit Power effects increase underwater visibility.\n\n  Color\n    Water has several colors, depending on the biome.\n\n    Biome,Water color,Water fog color,Block\n\n    Default (biomes not listed below),#3F76E4,#050533,\n\n    Swamp,#617B64,#232317,\n\n    Lukewarm Ocean Deep Lukewarm Ocean,#45ADF2,#041633,\n\n    Warm Ocean,#43D5EE,#041F33,\n\n    Cold Ocean Deep Cold Ocean Snowy Taiga Snowy Beach,#3D57D6,#050533,\n\n    Frozen River Frozen Ocean Deep Frozen Ocean,#3938C9,#050533,\n\n    Meadow,#0E4ECF,#050533,\n\n    Mangrove Swamp,#3A7A6A,#4D7A60,\n\n    Cherry Grove,#5DB7EF,#5DB7EF,\n\n\n    Biome tints\n\n    Biome,Water Surface Color,Water Fog Color,Water Fog Distance,Water Surface Transparency,Block\n\n    Default (biomes not listed below),#44aff5,#44aff5,15,65%,\n\n    Sunflower Plains Plains,#44aff5,#44aff5,60,-,\n\n    Desert,#32a598,#32a598,60,-,\n\n    Mountains,#007BF7,#007BF7,-,-,\n\n    Forest,#1e97f2,#1e97f2,60,-,\n\n    Flower Forest,#20a3CC,#20a3CC,60,-,\n\n    Taiga,#287082,#287082,60,-,\n\n    Taiga Mountains,#1e6B82,#1e6B82,-,-,\n\n    Swamp,#4c6559,#4c6559,30,100%,\n\n    River,#0084ff,#0084ff,60,-,\n\n    Nether Wastes Warped Forest Crimson Forest Soul Sand Valley,#905957,#905957,15,-,\n\n    Basalt Deltas,#3f76e4,#423e42,15,-,\n\n    The End,#62529e,#62529e,-,-,\n\n    Frozen River,#185390,#185390,60,-,\n\n    Snowy Tundra Ice Spikes,#14559b,#14559b,-,-,\n\n    Mushroom Fields,#8a8997,#8a8997,-,-,\n\n    Beach,#157cab,#157cab,60,-,\n\n    Mountain Edge,#045cd5,#045cd5,-,-,\n\n    Jungle Bamboo Jungle,#14a2c5,#14a2c5,60 15,-,\n\n    Jungle Edge,#0D8AE3,#0D8AE3,-,-,\n\n    Stone Shore,#0d67bb,#0d67bb,60,-,\n\n    Snowy Beach,#1463a5,#1463a5,60,-,\n\n    Birch Forest,#0677ce,#0677ce,60,-,\n\n    Dark Forest,#3B6CD1,#3B6CD1,60,-,\n\n    Snowy Taiga,#205e83,#205e83,60,-,\n\n    Giant Tree Taiga Giant Spruce Taiga,#2d6d77,#2d6d77,60,-,\n\n    Windswept Forest Windswept Gravelly Hills,#0E63AB,#0E63AB,-,-,\n\n    Savanna,#2C8B9C,#2C8B9C,60,-,\n\n    Savanna Plateau Shattered Savanna,#2590a8,#2590a8,-,-,\n\n    Badlands,#4E7f81,#4E7f81,60,-,\n\n    Eroded Badlands Wooded Badlands,#497f99,#497f99,-,-,\n\n    Ocean,#1787D4,#1165b0,60,-,\n\n    Deep Ocean,#1787D4,#1463a5,60,-,\n\n    Warm Ocean,#02B0E5,#0289d5,60,55%,\n\n    Lukewarm Ocean,#0D96DB,#0a74c4,60,-,\n\n    Lukewarm Deep Ocean,#0D96DB,#0e72b9,60,-,\n\n    Cold Ocean,#2080C9,#14559b,60,-,\n\n    Cold Deep Ocean,#2080C9,#185390,60,-,\n\n    Frozen Ocean,#2570B5,#174985,60,-,\n\n    Frozen Deep Ocean,#2570B5,#1a4879,60,-,\n\n    Mangrove Swamp,#3a7a6a,#4d7a60,30,-,\n\n\n    Biome tints from unused biomes\n\n    Biome,Water Surface Color,Water Fog Color,Water Fog Distance,Water Surface Transparency,Block\n\n    Legacy Frozen Ocean,#44aff5,#44aff5,-,-,\n\n    Mountains,#007BF7,#007bf7,-,-,\n\n    Taiga Mountains,#1e6B82,#1e6b82,-,-,\n\n    Swamp Hills,#4c6156,#4c6156,30,100%,\n\n    Snowy Mountains,#1156a7,#1156a7,-,-,\n\n    Mushroom Field Shore,#818193,#818193,-,-,\n\n    Desert Hills,#1a7aa1,#1a7aa1,-,-,\n\n    Wooded Hills,#056bd1,#056bd1,-,-,\n\n    Taiga Hills,#236583,#236583,-,-,\n\n    Mountain Edge,#045cd5,#045cd5,-,-,\n\n    Jungle Hills Modified Jungle Bamboo Jungle Hills,#1B9ED8,#1B9ED8,-,-,\n\n    Modified Jungle Edge,#0D8AE3,#0D8AE3,-,-,\n\n    Birch Forest Hills,#0a74c4,#0a74c4,-,-,\n\n    Snowy Taiga Mountains,#205e83,#205e83,60,-,\n\n    Snowy Taiga Hills,#245b78,#245b78,-,-,\n\n    Giant Tree Taiga Hills,#286378,#286378,-,-,\n\n    Gravelly Mountains+,#0E63AB,#0e63ab,-,-,\n\n    Shattered Savanna Plateau,#2590a8,#2590a8,-,-,\n\n    Badlands Plateau Modified Badlands Plateau,#55809E,#55809e,-,-,\n\n    Warm Deep Ocean,#02B0E5,#0686ca,60,-,\n\n\n  Water and lava\n    Water and lava can produce stone, cobblestone, or obsidian based on how they interact. If water touches a lava source, the lava source turns to obsidian. If both touch each other while flowing, cobblestone is made and no sources are removed, and if lava flows downward onto water, the water turns to stone.\n\n  Interactions with mobs\n    Water damages endermen, snow golems, striders and blazes, at a rate of 1 per half second. If water comes into contact with a shulker or an enderman, the mob teleports away. Players and mobs (except aquatic mobs, undead mobs and iron golems) have a breath meter that lasts 15 seconds. After they run out of breath, they take 2 suffocation damage every second until they die, surface, or enter bubble columns. Dolphins are a special case in drowning: they take suffocation damage when underwater for about 4 minutes, but also take suffocation damage when in air for about 2 minutes. Each level of the Respiration enchantment adds 15 seconds to the breath meter and grants an x/(x+1) chance (where x is the Respiration level) of not taking damage after that time: 30 seconds and an average 1/second with Respiration I, 45 seconds and an average of 2\u20443 damage/second with Respiration II, and 60 seconds and an average of 1\u20442 damage/second with Respiration III. If a husk suffocates underwater, it starts to shake and eventually becomes a zombie. If a zombie suffocates underwater, it starts to shake and eventually transforms into a drowned.\n\n  Slower mining speed\n    Players with their head underwater require 5 times the normal amount of time to mine blocks while standing on the ground, or 25 times while not on the ground. If a player wears a helmet with the Aqua Affinity enchantment, then underwater mining speed while standing on the ground is the same as on land, and 5 times slower if not standing on the ground.\n\n  Explosions\n    Water does not prevent explosions from activating. Water has a high blast resistance, causing it to absorb any normal blasts, with the exception of explosions from underwater TNT.\n\n  Hardening concrete powder\n    When water comes into contact with concrete powder, the powder hardens into solid concrete.\n\n  Sponges\n    When a dry sponge comes into contact with a water source or flowing block, it becomes a wet sponge, absorbing all water within 3 to 5 blocks in all directions. Kelp and lily pads within the absorbed water blocks are destroyed and drop as items, and seagrass is destroyed without dropping anything. Mobs that take damage out of water are affected as a side-effect. Sponges do not absorb water from waterlogged blocks, nor water that comes into contact by flowing back in from outside the area of absorption. For instance, placing a sponge 4 or more blocks from a single water source removes the flowing water in the area of effect, but as the flow from the source resumes it is not affected by the wet sponge. A sponge instantly absorbs nearby water when it is placed next to water or when water comes into contact with it (by being placed next to the sponge, or by flowing toward it). A sponge absorbs water around itself (water source blocks or flowing water) out to a taxicab distance of 7 in all directions (including up and down), but won't absorb more than 65 blocks of water (water closest to the sponge is absorbed first). The absorption propagates only from water to water and does not \"jump over\" non-water blocks (including air).\n\n  Dripping\n    Water above a non-transparent block (except for stairs, fences, or slabs) produces dripping particles on the underside of that block. If a block of pointed dripstone hangs under any block directly beneath a water source, the drips can slowly fill up a cauldron placed underneath. Without the dripstone, a cauldron does not fill.\n\n  Vertical transport\n    Bubble columns are created by placing magma blocks or soul sand under water. These can be used to transport mobs or items quickly vertically.\n\n",

Placement To place tripwire, use string while pointing at a surface facing the space the tripwire should occupy. A line of tripwire blocks can form a simple \"circuit\" when placed without gaps in a straight line (1 to 40 blocks long) between two tripwire hooks that face inward toward the tripwire blocks.  Multiple tripwire circuits can intersect one another, and the tripwire at each intersection can activate each circuit it belongs to. Activation A tripwire block is activated by any entity intersecting the tripwire hitbox, except spectators and area effect clouds. In Java Edition, the following entities also do not activate tripwire: thrown eyes of ender, the ender dragon, markers\u200c[Java Edition  only], and items clipped into solid blocks. Notably, there are some entities that still activate tripwire despite otherwise ignoring block collisions while moving, such as vexes\u200c[Java Edition  only], and thrown eyes of ender\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only].  Active tripwires do not produce redstone power, despite their active state being referred to in-game as \"powered\". Behavior [more information needed] When any entity activates an inactive tripwire, the tripwire first updates its immediate neighbors, and then searches to the south and west looking for tripwire hooks to signal to update (no search is done toward the east or north).  A search in any given direction is successful if a hook is found fewer than 41 blocks away, is facing toward the updater tripwire, and is connected to the updater tripwire by a continuous line of tripwire blocks. After these updates are processed, the activated tripwire schedules a block tick at its own position to be processed 10 game ticks later.  If the tripwire is still active during this scheduled tick, it checks whether there are any entities that should keep it activated. If there are any, the tripwire stays activated and schedules another block tick on itself for 10 game ticks later. If there are no entities that should keep the tripwire activated, the tripwire deactivates and sends the same updates as when initially activating -- namely, a neighbor update and a \"south-and-west signal\" for tripwire hooks to update. This same set of updates is also sent when tripwire is broken (including by being washed away by spreading water in Java Edition). If any tripwire hook is signaled to update and finds itself to be part of a valid tripwire circuit, it becomes active and produces a redstone signal in much the same way a button does. If a player holds shears in their main hand and attacks an inactive tripwire belonging to a valid tripwire circuit, that tripwire becomes \"disarmed\" and no longer sends out updates in response to entity interactions.\n\n  Trading\n    Novice-level fisherman villagers have a 50% chance to buy 20 string as part of their first-tier trade. Journeyman-level fletcher villagers buy 14 string for 1 emerald as part of their trade.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A command block is a block that can execute commands. Because it cannot be obtained or edited in Survival mode without cheats, it is primarily used on multiplayer servers, in Creative worlds, and custom maps. An impulse command block is the default block type; it executes only once when activated. A chain command block executes every time when triggered. A repeating command block executes every game tick as long as it is activated.\n\nObtaining\n    In Java Edition, command blocks are available in the Creative inventory under the \"Operator Utilities\" tab, if the \"Operator Items Tab\" setting in the \"Controls\" Options tab is set to \"ON\". Across both Java and Bedrock editions, they can either be obtained by using the pick block control, or by using various commands, such as /give @s minecraft:command_block, or /setblock ~ ~ ~ command_block. Just like other blocks that can store NBT data, using pick block + CTRL copies the command and options inside the command block. This allows it to be placed elsewhere without having to re-enter the data inside. Command blocks are not flammable, and have the same blast resistance as bedrock. Command blocks, structure blocks, and jigsaw blocks cannot be mined in Survival. Command blocks can be placed by a non-operator player.\n\nUsage\n    A command block can execute commands when activated by redstone power. It always has permissions of 2 level\u200c[Java Edition  only]/1 level\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only], so it can be used to allow a specific use of a command by players who can't use that command in general (for example, allowing anyone to obtain a specific item with /give without allowing everyone to /give themselves whatever they want). A command block has an orientation that determines the chain command block to activate, and the blocks to be checked to see if a command block in \"Conditional\" mode executes. To execute the command, in Java Edition in multiplayer enable-command-block in the server.properties file must be set to true (default is false); in Bedrock Edition \"Command Blocks Enabled\" in options must be enabled.\n\n  Modification\n    To enter command or modify the command block, use the Use Item control on the command block to open the command block GUI (graphical user interface). The GUI opens only if the player is in Creative mode, and has the proper permissions. That means, in singleplayer, \"Allow Cheats\"\u200c[JE  only] or \"Activate Cheats\"\u200c[BE  only] in options must be enabled. In multiplayer, Gui can be opened only by operators in Creative mode, and in Java Edition op-permission-level in the server.properties file must be set to 2 or above (default is 4). In Java Edition to enter command or modify the command block, enable-command-block in the server.properties file must be set to true (default is false). In Java Edition, opening the GUI in singleplayer pauses the game. Console Command\u200c[JE  only]/Command Input\u200c[BE  only] Commands can be entered in the top text pane. The text limit for commands in a command block is 32,500 characters, but the text pane can show only a small portion of this amount at a time. Commands in a command block do not need to be prefixed with the forward-slash (/) as they do in the chat window, but doing so still works. Press Tab \u21b9 to complete words or cycle through options. In Bedrock Edition, below the console command text pane are some reminder tips about how to use target selectors. Previous Output The bottom text pane displays the output message (success or failure) of the last executed command (it is blank\u200c[JE  only] or \" - \"\u200c[BE  only] initially). Its text is not editable. A button to the right of the Previous Output text pane\u200c[JE  only] or the left of the \"Previous Output\"\u200c[BE  only] specifies whether the last output should be stored and displayed. It is O\u200c[JE  only]/enabled\u200c[BE  only] when the output text should be stored and X\u200c[JE  only]/disabled\u200c[BE  only] when the output text should not be stored. For worlds with many command blocks, especially command blocks running on fast clocks, not storing the output text can reduce memory and storage requirements. If gamerule sendCommandFeedback is true (the default), default to O\u200c[JE  only]/enabled\u200c[BE  only]. Otherwise defaults to X\u200c[JE  only]/disabled\u200c[BE  only]. Block Type Click the \"Impulse/Chain/Repeat\"\u200c[JE  only]/\"Block Type\"\u200c[BE  only] button to change the command block's type. The default state is \"Impulse\", but non-default command blocks can be obtained and placed. The command block also changes color when changing its command block type: \"Impulse\" command blocks are orange. They execute once every time they are activated.\n\"Chain\" command blocks are green. They execute once every time they are triggered if they have been activated.\n\"Repeat\" command blocks are purple. They execute their commands once every one game tick (or more\u200c[BE  only]) as long as they are activated. Condition Click the \"Conditional/Unconditional\"\u200c[JE  only]/\"Condition\"\u200c[BE  only] button to change the command block's conditional behavior:\n\"Conditional\": A command block in conditional mode executes its command only when the command block behind it has executed successfully (\"Success count\" is greater than 0).\n\"Unconditional\" (default): A command block in unconditional mode executes its command even if there's a command block behind it that didn't execute its command successfully.\n\"Behind it\" in the sense of opposite to the direction the command block is facing, regardless of chain direction or even if chaining is occurring. Redstone Click the \"Always Active/Needs Redstone\"\u200c[JE  only]/\"Redstone\"\u200c[BE  only] button to change the command block's activation requirements:\n\"Needs Redstone\" (the default for impulse and repeat command blocks): A command block in the \"Needs Redstone\" setting can be activated only with redstone.\n\"Always Active\" (the default for chain command blocks): The command block is activated when set to \"Always Active\". Then it is always active even without redstone activation. Execute on First Tick\u200c[BE  only] Specifies whether a repeat command block executes its command as soon as it is activated. If it's disabled, executes the first time after the delay from the time when it is activated. Delay in Ticks\u200c[BE  only] For impulse or chain command block, specifies how many game ticks it delays before executing a command after it is activated or triggered.\nFor repeat command block, specifies how many game ticks it delays to execute again. Note that for impulse or repeat command block, 0 and 1 work the same; the game takes 0 as 1. However, For chain command block, 0 and 1 are different. Hover Note\u200c[BE  only] Specifies the name of the command block, which can be seen when you point to the block. It is also used for message commands. If the command block had been named in an anvil before placement, that name is used as well. If it is empty, defaults to !. Done In Java Edition, click the \"Done\" button or \u21b5 Enter to save the command and leave the command block GUI.\nIn Bedrock Edition, close the GUI to save the command and changes. Cancel Click the \"Cancel\" button or Esc\u200c[JE  only]to leave the command block GUI without saving any changes.\n\n  Activation\n    Command blocks are redstone mechanisms and can be activated by: A command block can also be activated by setting it to \"Always Active\" mode. When activated, a command block executes its command, depending on the command block's type:\n\n  Execution\n    An impulse command block, when it is activated, checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). After the delay of 1 game tick (or more\u200c[BE  only]), if the condition is met before the delay (if in \"Conditional\" mode), it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to. A repeat command block, when it is activated, after 1 game tick (always 1 no matter how many \"Delay in Ticks\" is), checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode). If the condition is met, and if \"Execute on First Tick\u200c\" is enabled in Bedrock Edition, it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to. If it is still activated, it then checks, executes, and triggers the chain command block again after 1 game tick (or more\u200c[BE  only]). When executing a command, it also updates its success count: If in \"Conditional\" mode, if the command block behind it didn't execute successfully, it sets its success count to 0. Otherwise, it sets it to the success count of the command. Also: If any command block having executed its command (whether successfully or unsuccessfully) faces a chain command block, it triggers the chain command block to also attempt execution. When a chain command block is triggered, Chained command blocks execute simultaneously in the same game tick in the order they are chained. In Bedrock Edition, it can also delay before executing commands if \"Delay in Ticks\" is not 0: When it is triggered,\nIf it has been activated, the chain command block checks whether the command block behind it has executed successfully (if in conditional mode), then it delays.\nAfter a delay, if the condition is met before the delay (if in \"Conditional\" mode), it executes its command once and triggers the chain command block it is pointing to no matter whether the condition met.\nIf it has not been activated, it triggers (without delay) the chain command block it is facing to attempt execution. In Java Edition, it can execute multiple times in the same game tick if \"UpdateLastExecution\" is set to false. In this case, it does not check whether it has already executed in this game tick. If the chain command block has been activated when triggered, it also updates its success count: If in \"Conditional\" mode, if the command block behind it didn't execute successfully, it sets its success count to 0. Otherwise, it sets it to the success count of the command.\n\n  Output\n    When activated, a command block can produce multiple types of output: A command block can power a redstone comparator facing away from it (possibly separated by a block) with signal strength specific to the success count. Success count is an integer between 0 to 2,147,483,647 (inclusive). The signal strength always reflects the last command executed, even after the command block is deactivated. In Java Edition, success count is usually 0 or 1, except for /function and /execute. In Bedrock Edition, success count is an integer related to the command (e.g., the number of players affected by the command, the number of blocks that were altered, the value returned by the command, etc.) In Java Edition, leaving the command block GUI by clicking \"Done\" or pressing \u21b5 Enter resets the success count to 0, regardless of whether changes were made in the GUI. In Bedrock Edition, leaving the GUI with changes resets the success count to 0. The output message describes the success or failure of the executed command, and may be written to multiple destinations: Previous Output: The output message is always written to the \"Previous Output\" text pane of the command block GUI. Chat: The output message is written to the chat text in singleplayer mode, or broadcast to all other ops in multiplayer mode, unless it has been suppressed with /gamerule commandBlockOutput false. Some commands may write additional text to the chat as their normal function, which won't be suppressed (for example, the /say command writes a message to the chat of all players), separate from the output message. Chat messages that would usually be prefaced by a player's name (such as from the /me, /say and /tell commands) use @ \u200c[Java Edition  only] / ! \u200c[Bedrock Edition  only] as the player name. If the command block had been named in an anvil before placement, that name is used instead. In Bedrock Edition, it can also modified in the GUI. Logs: The output message is written to multiplayer server logs unless it has been suppressed with /gamerule logAdminCommands false.\n\n  Notes\n    Command blocks execute commands with OP level 2.  The following commands cannot be used in a command block: /ban, /banlist, /ban-ip, /debug, /deop, /kick\u200c[JE  only], /op, /pardon, /pardon-ip, /publish, /reload\u200c[BE  only], /save-all, /save-off, /save-on, /stop, and /whitelist (i.e., /debug, /publish, and all of the multiplayer-only commands except /list). Running \"Searge\" (case insensitive) as the command in the command block without a preceding \"/\" will set the previous output to \"#itzlipofutzli\". Its success count is 1.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Command blocks cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed or pulled by sticky pistons.\n\n",

Each random tick, weeping vines have a 10% chance of growing one block downward. At default random tick speed, each fungus grows approximately every 13653 game ticks (11.3775 minutes). Weeping vines stop growing once they reach the ground or when the block reaches an age block state of 25, whichever is first. Bonemeal can be used to extend weeping vines and can be used anywhere in the chain to extend the whole chain. This can be useful for getting down from a high place in the nether.\n\nUsage\n    Weeping vines can be placed on, and grow from, the bottom of a block. The top-most vine block always has a starting age value of 0, which increments every time the block grows. If the bottom-most vine block has an age below 25, it continues to grow provided that there is free space below the vine. When the vine does grow, a new vine block with an incremented age value is placed beneath it. Weeping vines stop growing if shears are used on the tip.\u200c\u200c[Java Edition  only]\n\n  Climbing\n    Weeping vines can be climbed by standing in them and holding the jump key.

Chests always drop themselves when mined. If the chest contains items, the items are also dropped when the chest is broken.

They generate in monster rooms, strongholds, villages, jungle temples, desert temples, nether fortresses, end cities, igloos, woodland mansions, shipwrecks, ocean ruins, buried treasure, pillager outposts, bastion remnants, ruined portals, and ancient cities. Large chests can occasionally generate in monster rooms by one single chest generating next to the other. They can also generate in certain types of bastion remnants. The bonus chest is a chest that appears near the player's spawn if the \"Bonus chest\" option is toggled on the main menu. It generates with a semi-random collection of basic items to help the player survive early on and gather necessary resources, including wood, tools, blocks, and food.\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Any Planks,\"[['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks'], ['Oak Planks', None, 'Oak Planks'], ['Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks', 'Oak Planks']]\"\n\n\nUsage\n    Chests can be used as containers and as crafting ingredients. To place a chest, use the Place Block control on the face of a block adjacent to the space the chest should occupy. A chest placed adjacent to another chest joins to create a large chest. A player can prevent this, and place two small chests side by side, by sneaking while placing the second chest\u200c[JE  only], pushing a chest into place with a piston\u200c[BE  only], or placing the second chest facing a different direction from the first chest. Alternatively, trapped chests do not combine with normal chests. Chests can be moved by pistons,\u200c[BE  only] and water and lava flow around chests without affecting them. Lava can create fire in air blocks next to chests as if the chests were flammable, but the chests do not actually catch fire and cannot be burned.\n\n  Container\n    A small chest has 27 slots of inventory space, and a large chest has twice that amount, at 54 slots. In the Java Edition interface, the top three rows for a large chest correspond to the left half of the chest when facing it, and the bottom three rows correspond to the right half. In Bedrock Edition, the top three rows correspond to whichever half was placed first and the bottom three to the other half. Chests open when used. To move items between the chest inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the chest GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. Holding \u21e7 Shift and double-clicking while holding an item moves all items of the type clicked on in or out of the chest, to the extent that space is available for them.\u200c[Java Edition  only] To exit the chest GUI, use the Esc control. A chest cannot be opened if there is an opaque block above it (in Bedrock Edition, bottom-half slabs prevent chests from being opened). Solid faces do not prevent chests from opening, so the lid of the chest can phase through blocks such as bottom-half slabs, stairs, and transparent full cubes such as glass and ice. Ocelots and cats sitting on chests prevent them from opening. Because chests themselves are functionally transparent, two chests can be stacked on top of one another while still allowing the lower chest to be opened. Players can open chests when players are being hurt (effect of instant damage, poison, wither, fatal poison or on fire) or hurt by anyone (players, zombies, skeletons, etc.). By default, the GUI of a chest is labeled \"Chest\" and the GUI of a large chest is labeled \"Large Chest\". A chest's GUI label can be changed by naming the chest in an anvil before placing it, or by using the /data command\u200c[Java Edition  only] (for example, to label a chest at (0,64,0) as \"Bonus Chest!\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Bonus Chest!\"'}). If half of a large chest is renamed, that name is used to label the GUI of the entire large chest, but if the named half is destroyed the other half reverts to the default label. If both halves of a large chest have different names, the GUI uses the name of the northernmost or westernmost half. In Java Edition, a chest can be \"locked\" by setting its \u00a0Lock tag using the /data command. If a chest's \u00a0Lock tag is not blank, the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a chest at (0,64,0) so that the chest cannot be opened unless the player is holding an item named \"Chest Key\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Chest Key\"}. The capacity of a chest varies greatly, depending on its size, whether the items inside it are stackable, and whether shulker boxes are used. The minimum capacity is obtained when storing only non-stackable items while the maximum capacity can be achieved when storing items that stack to 64. Filled shulker boxes are not stackable, but each can hold 27 stacks of up to 64 items (excluding other shulker boxes), so filling a chest with them increases the maximum by a factor of 27.\n\n    Chest Size,Slots,Maximum Number of Items\n\n    Without shulker boxes,With shulker boxes\n\n    Small,27,\"1,728\",\"46,656\"\n\n    Large,54,\"3,456\",\"93,312\"\n\n\n  Donkey, mule, or llama pack\n    A chest can be added to a donkey, a mule, or a llama by pressing use on the respective animal. A chest attached to a donkey or mule has only 15 slots. A chest attached to a llama has anywhere from 3 to 15 slots depending upon its \"Strength\" value (see Llama \u00a7 Data values). The chest cannot be removed except by killing the carrier. The chest can be opened by holding sneak and pressing use, or by riding the carrier and pressing inventory. If shulker boxes are again used, each donkey, mule or strength value 5 llamas with a chest attached to it can carry up to 405 stacks of items (up to 25920 items), and with strength value 5 llamas, each caravan of 10 llamas with inventories full of shulker boxes can carry up to 4050 stacks of items (up to 259200 items).\n\n  Piglins\n    Piglins become hostile toward players who open or mine chests.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Boat with Chest,Chest + Matching Boat,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Oak Boat', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n    Hopper,Iron Ingot + Chest,\"[['Iron Ingot', None, 'Iron Ingot'], ['Iron Ingot', '', 'Iron Ingot'], [None, 'Iron Ingot', None]]\"\n\n    Minecart with Chest,Chest + Minecart,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Minecart', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n    Shulker Box,Shulker Shell + Chest,\"[[None, 'Shulker Shell', None], [None, '', None], [None, 'Shulker Shell', None]]\"\n\n    Trapped Chest,Tripwire Hook + Chest,\"[[None, None, None], ['Tripwire Hook', '', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Fuel\n    Chests can be used as fuel in furnaces, smelting 1.5 items per chest.\n\n  Note blocks\n    Chests can be placed under note blocks to produce the \"bass\" sound.\n\nChristmas chest\n    On December 24\u201326, chests, large chests, and their trapped chest counterparts have their textures changed to \"Christmas chests\" that look like wrapped Christmas presents.

Grass spreading without player intervention depends heavily on the time of day.\u200c[Java Edition  only] For a dirt block to accept grass from a nearby grass block, the following requirements must be met: When grass is random ticked, it spreads by checking 4 blocks within range and converts any dirt blocks selected into grass. Though water and lava are both light-filtering blocks (meaning they decrease skylight by 1 level but do not affect block light), other light-filtering blocks such as ice and slime blocks do not block grass from spreading to the dirt block. Grass blocks can grow under all other transparent blocks like glass, fences, or torches. Grass jumps directly from one block to a neighbor and is not affected by gaps or other blocks being \"in the way.\" Grass blocks spread at random intervals and have an equal chance of spreading to any suitable dirt blocks that are in range. Because grass can spread as much as 3 levels downward, it tends to spread down slopes much faster than it spreads up them.\n\nAppearance\n    The coloration of grass blocks is dependent on the biome they are in. A grass block always uses the color set to its location, regardless of how it was placed or of its source. This affects the side and top of the block. In Bedrock Edition, biome colors also appear on maps.[1]\n\n  Color\n    These values are generated by the biome dyeing algorithm.

Passive mobs tend to wander toward grass blocks. They also wander toward light. When a sheep eats a grass block, the block becomes dirt, and a sheared sheep regrows its wool. Tilling a grass block with a hoe converts it to a farmland block. Dirt paths can be created by using any type of shovel on the side or top of a grass block with air above it. The shovel loses 1 durability for each dirt path block created.\n\n  Death\n    Grass dies and changes to dirt a random time (when a random tick lands on the block) after it has been covered by any opaque blocks. Transparent blocks can kill grass in a similar manner if they cause the light level above the grass block to be four or below (like water does), and the surrounding area is not otherwise sufficiently illuminated.\n\n  Spawning\n    In Java Edition, animals occasionally spawn on grass blocks that have light level 9 or brighter in the space directly above. This is quite rare and requires that there be few other animals nearby or in the spawn chunks. Most animals are instead created along with the terrain. In Bedrock Edition, most animals require surface grass blocks (grass blocks with no solid block anywhere above them at the same x, z coordinate) to spawn. Animals regularly spawn in most Overworld biomes on surface grass blocks that have light level 7 or brighter in the space directly above.\n\n  Snowy Grass Block\n    Grass blocks turn into a snowy grass block if a snow, powder snow or a snow block is placed on top of the block. Removing the snow layer will turn the block into a normal grass block.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing grass blocks into a composter has a 30% chance of raising the compost level by 1.\u200c[Bedrock Edition  only]\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    Honey blocks are storage blocks equivalent to four honey bottles. Honey blocks are sticky and can be used in conjunction with pistons to move blocks and adhered entities.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Honey blocks can be broken instantly, and always drop as an item, regardless of held items.\n\n    Block,Honey Block\n\n    Hardness,0\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.05\n\n\n  Crafting\n    Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Honey Bottle,\"[['Honey Bottle', 'Honey Bottle', None], ['Honey Bottle', 'Honey Bottle', None], [None, None, None]]\",Empty bottles remain in the crafting grid after crafting the honey block.\n\n\n    The 2\u00d72 inventory crafting grid is sufficient to craft a honey block.\n\nUsage\n  Redstone\n    Unlike the slime block, the honey block does not carry a redstone signal because it is a transparent block.\u200c[Java Edition  only] When being moved by a piston, entities on a honey block's top surface move with it. They are not launched in the direction of the push, as a slime block would do. When a honey block is moved by a piston, it attempts to move all adjacent blocks in the same direction. A honey block can move any block a sticky piston can pull, except for glazed terracotta and slime blocks. The blocks that are moved may, in turn, push other blocks, as if they were being pushed by a piston. For example, a honey block sitting on the ground attempts to move the ground block underneath itself, which pushes additional ground blocks in the direction of motion. When the adjacent block that is moved is also a honey block, that block also attempts to move all its adjacent blocks. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d72 cube of honey blocks may be pushed or pulled as a unit by a single piston acting on any of the blocks in the cube. A honey block adjacent to a block that cannot be moved by pistons ignores the immobile block. However, if an adjacent block could be moved but is prevented by the presence of an immobile block, the honey block is also prevented from moving. Liquids are an exception: they are not moved, but neither do they stop a piston from pushing or pulling blocks into their space (usually destroying the liquid, and in a rare case displacing it through the piston). Honey blocks, unlike slime blocks, cannot have a redstone signal sent through them via a repeater or an observer, etc. Honey blocks are not pulled by a non-sticky piston, nor are they moved if an adjacent (non-honey) block is moved by a piston. The maximum of 12 blocks moved by a piston still applies. For example, a 2\u00d72\u00d73 of honey blocks may be pushed or pulled by a sticky piston as long as no other movable blocks are adjacent to it. However, the platform in which a honey block shifts is entirely dependent on the placement of the sticky piston, as well as placement of blocks too. In Java Edition honey blocks moved by pistons do not move entities that are touching the side or bottom of the block.[1]\nIn Bedrock Edition honey blocks moved by pistons do move entities that are touching the side of the block.[more information needed\u00a0for Bedrock Edition]\n\n  Slowing down entities\n    Honey blocks slow down entities walking on top of them and prevent them from jumping. Players walking on honey blocks move 2.508 m/s, about a 60% reduction from the normal walking speed. In Bedrock Edition, players also slow down slightly if walking up against the side of it. Players, who can ordinarily jump about 1\u00a01\u20444 blocks high, can jump about 3\u204416 blocks high on honey; this is an 85% reduction. They can more easily step up onto other blocks than jump up onto them. This effect applies even through other blocks on top of honey blocks as long as they are half-block or less in height - so the player cannot jump on carpets, bottom slabs or daylight detectors that are placed on honey blocks. This effect also applies regardless of a player's mode of movement, such as flying with elytra or swimming.\n\n  Sliding\n    Entities pressed against the sides of a honey block slide down at a slow speed and do not take fall damage, similar to going down a ladder but with a gradually decreasing horizontal momentum.\u200c[Java Edition  only] This allows players to jump 2 blocks further by holding on to the walls. The slowdown induced by honey blocks also stacks with the Slow Falling status effect.\n\n  Falling\n    As with hay bales, falling onto a honey block reduces fall damage by 80%. For example, if a player or mob falls from a height that would normally cause 10 fall damage, the fall causes 2 damage instead.\n\n  Bees\n    When a honey block is near bees and a beehive or bee nest, bees occasionally fly close and attach to it for a few seconds, resembling an action of eating honey. When doing this, the bee stops fluttering its wings, and firmly attaches its face to the honey block regardless of whether flowers are nearby.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Although the 2\u00d72 inventory crafting grid is sufficient to craft a honey block, a 3\u00d73 crafting table grid is required to convert a honey block back into four honey bottles.\n\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Honey Bottle,Glass Bottle + Honey Block,\"[[None, None, None], ['Glass Bottle', 'Glass Bottle', ''], ['Glass Bottle', 'Glass Bottle', None]]\"\n\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    An anvil is a gravity-affected utility block used to rename items, combine enchantments and repair items without losing the enchantments. An anvil has limited durability, and as it is used or dropped too far, gradually becomes a chipped anvil, then a damaged anvil, then breaks into nothing.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    Anvils can be mined using any pickaxe.

Also, if the target item is at full durability and the sacrifice does not have any enchantments, the anvil also refuses to combine the items, unless if renaming the item to a valid name. In addition, the player can rename any item \u2013 not just items with durability \u2013 by using an anvil. Repairing with materials works for the most part, but not with all items: in general, repairing works for items with their material in the default name. For example, an anvil can repair an iron pickaxe with materials (iron in this case) while an anvil cannot repair bows or shears except with other bows or shears. Special cases: chain armor can be repaired with iron ingots, turtle shells can be repaired with scutes, and elytra can be repaired with phantom membranes. The repair does not need to be complete; one material repairs 1\u20444 of the item's maximum durability. Repair of an unenchanted item can cost more material than simply crafting a new item or combining damaged items. The exception is armor, which consumes less material at the cost of experience levels. Repairing with a matching item works for any item with durability including bows, shears and so on. The items must be a matching tool and of a matching material. For example, a golden pickaxe cannot combine with a golden sword or iron pickaxe. In both cases, the resulting durability is limited to the item's maximum, and there is no discount for \"over-repair\". As a subset of repairing one item with another, the anvil can transfer enchantments from the sacrifice to the target. This can have a synergistic effect when both items share identical enchantments, or simply add to each other when they do not. Two Sharpness II swords can be combined to make a Sharpness III sword, for example, or a pickaxe with Efficiency can be combined with one that has Unbreaking. This can produce enchantments and combinations that are not possible with an enchanting table. But even so, some enchantments cannot be combined if they are similar, or contradicting, in terms of what they do. If the target is damaged, the player has to pay for the repair as well as the transfer. Transferring high-level enchantments is more expensive, and renaming an item has an additional surcharge. The anvil has a limit of 39 levels; beyond that, repairs are refused. This limit is not present in Creative mode. Every time armor or tools are repaired, the minimum experience cost doubles (e.g., 1 level, 2 levels, 4 levels, 8 levels, etc.). Any item or stack of items can be renamed at a cost of one level plus any prior-work penalty. If the player is only renaming, the maximum total cost is 39 levels. The maximum length for renaming is 30 characters\u200c[BE  only] or 50 characters\u200c[JE  only]. Some items have special effects when renamed: Any name changes to items are applied to the data tag {Item:{tag:{display:{Name:\"{\\\"text\\\":\\\"<name>\\\"}\"}}}}. Similarly, this data tag can be accessed by the nbt argument using target selectors. If the item name field is left blank, or is only whitespace or non-breaking spaces (or a combination of both), the default name for that item is used instead. Also, if the item name is unchanged from its current name (which can occur when renaming an item for the first time and using any of the aforementioned blank parameters), a red \"X\" appears on top of the arrow in the GUI. Named items do not stack with unnamed or differently-named items of the same type.\n\n  Enchanted books\n    Enchanted books can be used to enchant tools, armor and weapons. Enchanted books themselves can be combined to create higher-tiered books. This makes an anvil an alternative to the enchantment table.\n\n  Falling anvils\n    When there is no supporting block below an anvil, the anvil falls in the same way sand, gravel, concrete powder, and dragon eggs fall. A placed anvil cannot be pushed or pulled by pistons,\u200c[Java Edition  only] but a falling anvil can be pushed (though cannot be pulled), as it is an entity. This is different in Bedrock Edition where anvils can be pushed and pulled by pistons. Anvils make a metallic clang sound when they land. A falling anvil damages any player or mob that it falls on. The damage amount depends on fall distance: 2 per block fallen after the first (e.g., an anvil that falls 4 blocks deals 6 damage). The damage is capped at 40 \u00d7 20, no matter how far the anvil falls. Wearing a helmet reduces the damage by 1\u20444, but this costs twice as much durability on the helmet as on other armor pieces. When a player dies by an anvil falling on them, the death message \"<player> was squashed by a falling anvil\" appears. However, if a player is merely touched by a falling anvil entity, no damage is dealt unless the falling anvil becomes an anvil block in the same block where the player is located. If an anvil falls onto a block with a solid top surface, but the same block it is in cannot be replaced (torch, slab, etc.), it breaks and drops as an item. An anvil can fall into the void if there is a straight path to it.\n\n  Maps\n    In Bedrock Edition, an anvil can be used instead of a crafting table to zoom a map out, to clone a map, or to place a player position marker on a map.\n\n    Name,Ingredients,Anvil usage,Description\n\n    Map or Locator Map (zoomed out),Map or Locator Map + Paper,Repair\u2007&\u2007Name Map Locator\u2007Map,Bedrock Edition only.

The input map must be a locator map for the output to be a locator map; an empty map has no effect.\n\n    Locator Map,Map + Compass,Repair\u2007&\u2007Name Map,\"Bedrock Edition only. Maps crafted with only paper do not show the location marker; to add it, a compass must be added to the map.\"\n\n\n    However, with the introduction of the cartography table, this feature became dispensable.\n\n  Becoming damaged\n    With each use, an anvil has a 12% chance to become damaged \u2013 degrading one stage at a time, first becoming chipped, then damaged, then eventually destroyed. An anvil typically survives for 25 uses on average or approximately one use per 1.24 iron ingots used in crafting the anvil. An anvil can be damaged and destroyed from falling. If it falls from a height greater than one block, the chance of degrading by one stage is 5% \u00d7 the number of blocks fallen. The damage state does not affect the anvil's function, but only anvils of the same damage state can stack in inventory. When an anvil is destroyed, the player automatically leaves the anvil GUI and it disappears.\n\nCreative mode\n    In creative mode, the anvil functions a little differently than other game modes:\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    Fire is a non-solid block that can spread to nearby flammable blocks and destroy them.\n\nObtaining\n    Fire cannot be obtained as an item under any circumstances in Java Edition, though in Bedrock Edition fire may be obtained as an item via inventory editing.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Fire naturally generates in fire patches across the terrain of the Nether. Fire also generates on top of netherrack in some treasure room bastion remnants. In the End, fire generates on bedrock blocks on top of end spikes, at the same location as the end crystals.\n\n  Post-generation\n    Lava generated next to flammable blocks can naturally cause fires. Fire spreads quickly across flammable blocks, and can spontaneously ignite when flammable blocks are near lava, even though many blocks that should be flammable cannot catch fire from nearby lava. Lightning strikes can also set fires, regardless of whether they are created naturally, redirected to lightning rods, summoned by a trident enchanted with Channeling, or created using the /summon command. Placing an end crystal on bedrock or obsidian in the End causes fire to appear at the end crystal's location. The explosion from sleeping in a bed in the Nether or the End creates fire, as does the explosion of a ghast fireball or the impact of a blaze fireball. Using a charged respawn anchor in the Overworld or the End also creates fire from the explosion.\n\nUsage\n  Placement\n    Fire can be placed using flint and steel or a fire charge. Fire created on soul sand or soul soil becomes soul fire. When placed, a fire burns for a short and randomly determined amount of time. If nothing flammable is adjacent to it, the flames die out. Water that touches fire extinguishes it. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]\n\n  Burning entities\n    Players and many mobs burn when exposed to fire. Burning obstructs the player's view slightly. While inside a fire block, the fire inflicts damage at a rate of 1 per half-second unless the player or mob has Fire Resistance or a total Fire Protection of 7 or higher.\u200c[BE  only] When the player is on fire outside the fire block, they take damage at 1 per second. This is the same rate that the player gains health in Peaceful difficulty, so burning alone cannot kill the player in this mode. Soul fire deals damage at a rate of 2 per half-second, making it more dangerous than normal fire. After leaving a fire source, the player or mob continues burning for some time depending on how long it was exposed to the fire (stored in a Fire tag shared by all entities). Players and mobs that are burning can be extinguished by powder snow, rain, water or a cauldron. Most dropped items that are in fire briefly catch fire and disappear. This includes the item forms of blocks that would not be flammable if placed, including obsidian. The only exceptions are these netherite-related items: netherite tools and weapons, netherite armor, blocks of netherite, netherite scrap, netherite ingots, and ancient debris. If a mob able to drop meat dies while on fire, it drops the cooked version of it, with the exception of fish that is dropped by polar bears\u200c[JE  only] or guardians. This also applies to the zombie's uncommon potato drop; if a zombie dies while on fire and should drop a potato, it becomes a baked potato.\u200c[JE  only] Most Nether mobs are invulnerable to fire and cannot burn. Exceptions include skeletons, as well as endermen, piglins, piglin brutes, and hoglins. Zoglins are also invulnerable to fire. Burning is not considered a status effect and therefore cannot be cured by milk.\n\n  Spread\n    Fire spreads over flammable surfaces and can climb up walls, across floors and ceilings, and over small gaps. More precisely, a fire block can turn any air block that is adjacent to a flammable block into a fire block. This can happen at a distance of up to one block downward, one block sideways (including diagonals), and four blocks upward of the original fire block (not the block the fire is on/next to). Therefore, if the player is using fire to build a fireplace, caution is needed. Blocks in the way do not prevent fire from igniting blocks above it\u2014so even if the player protects a wooden roof with cobblestone between it and the fire, the fire ignores that cobblestone. Fire spreads from a still lava block similarly: any air block one above and up to one block sideways (including diagonals) or two above and two blocks sideways (including diagonals) that is adjacent to a flammable block may be turned into a fire block. Fire that naturally spreads into a valid nether portal frame activates the portal. Fire can spread onto and burn away any flammable block (or in the case of TNT, ignite it). On the other hand, a fire that is not adjacent to any flammable block and not on top of a forever-burning block does not spread, even to another flammable block within the normal range. In the following table, the higher the ignite odds, the more quickly a block catches fire if the fire is available to spread there. The higher the burn odds, the more quickly a block on fire burns away. These are relative values; actual ignite odds and burn time depends not only on these values, but on difficulty, rain, the age of the fire, the direction of the block relative to the fire, and multiple random values including how long the fire waits between block ticks and further checks based on the previous factors. Fire spread is reduced if tries to spread to a block more two blocks higher than itself. Fire spread is further reduced by 50% if the flammable blocks in a humid biome (swamp, mushroom fields and jungle, excluding sparse jungle).\n\n    Block,Ignite odds,Burn odds,Can catch fire from lava\n\n    Logs Stripped Logs Wood Stripped Wood Block of Coal,5,5,Yes\n\n    Overworld Planks Overworld Wooden Slabs Overworld Fence Gates Overworld Fences Overworld Wooden Stairs Composter Beehive Mangrove Roots Bamboo Mosaic Bamboo Mosaic Slab Bamboo Mosaic Stairs,5,20,Yes\n\n    Target,15,20,Yes\n\n    Cave Vines Cave Vines Plant,15,60,No\n\n    TNT ( ignites instead of vanishing) Vines Glow Lichen,15,100,Yes\n\n    Bookshelf Lectern Bee Nest,30,20,Yes\n\n    Leaves Wool Dried Kelp Block Azalea Hanging Roots,30,60,Yes\n\n    Carpets (except Moss ),JE,60,20,Yes\n\n    BE,30,60\n\n    Hay Bale,60,20,Yes\n\n    Bamboo Scaffolding,60,60,Yes\n\n    \"Flowers , 1-block Sweet Berry Bush\",JE,60,100,Yes\n\n    BE,30\n\n    \"Flowers , 2-block Grass Tall Grass Fern Large Fern Dead Bush Big Dripleaf Big Dripleaf Stem Small Dripleaf Spore Blossom Pitcher Plant\",60,100,Yes\n\n    Bamboo Shoot \u200c [ Bedrock Edition only ],?,?,Yes\n\n\n    Non-flammable blocks can be lit but do not burn away, and such fire does not spread. Non-flammable blocks other than netherrack or magma blocks extinguish themselves quickly. In the End, bedrock also does not extinguish itself. If a block is a part of a flammable material, it catches fire from lava. However, certain blocks do not burn away:\n\n    Block,Can catch fire from lava,Can burn away\n\n    Bamboo Shoot,JE,Yes,Yes\n\n    BE,No,Yes\n\n    Banners Barrel Campfire Cartography Table Chest Crafting Table Crimson Roots Daylight Detector Fletching Table Jukebox Loom Mushroom Blocks Nether Sprouts Note Block Smithing Table Trapped Chest Warped Roots Wooden Doors of all types Wooden Hanging Signs of all types Wooden Pressure Plates of all types Wooden Trapdoors of all types Wooden Signs,Yes,No\n\n    Wooden Buttons of all types,JE,No,No\n\n    BE,Yes\n\n    Bed,JE,Yes,No\n\n    BE,No\n\n    Wood-like blocks such as: Cobweb Grindstone Ladder Lever Moss Block Moss Carpet Piston Rails of all types Redstone Torch Saplings Smoker Torch Tripwire Tripwire Hook Stems Stripped Stems Hyphae Stripped Hyphae Nether Planks Nether Wood Slabs Nether Fence Gates Nether Fences Nether Wood Stairs and all other non-flammable blocks...,No,No\n\n\n  Extinguishing\n    Fire burns out after a while when on a non-flammable block other than netherrack or magma blocks; however, punching or hitting the side of a burning block extinguishes the fire on that side, making the Fire extinguished sound (see below). Hitting fire while holding a tool does not reduce the tool's durability. Placing blocks on the fire also extinguishes it. Water and lava extinguish fires that they flow into, and thrown splash and lingering water bottles extinguish fires in the block hit and the four blocks horizontally surrounding it. Mobs on fire are extinguished when in water or in a cauldron containing it. In the latter case, one layer of water disappears. Fire extinguishes more quickly if nothing flammable is present, and soon after it consumes a flammable block immediately beneath it. If a fire is exposed to rain, it extinguishes quickly.\n\n  Eternal fire\n    When lit, netherrack and magma blocks maintain fire forever, unless extinguished by any method except rain. Bedrock in the End also burns eternally. Eternal fire cannot exist on the sides of these blocks. The blocks that can support eternal fire are defined per-dimension, in the #infiniburn_overworld, #infiniburn_nether, and #infiniburn_end block tags. If /gamerule doFireTick is false, fire lasts forever until it is put out by the player, and does not spread or affect flammable blocks.\n\n  Bees\n    Setting fire to a beehive or bee nest causes the contained bees to be ejected from the block.\n\n",

Cocoa pods are bonemealable plants placed on jungle log sides that grow cocoa beans, and can be found naturally in jungles.\n\nObtaining\n    In Java Edition, cocoa beans are only obtained through the natural generation of cocoa pods, while in Bedrock Edition, they can also be found in bonus chests, from fishing inside the jungle, bamboo jungle and sparse jungle biomes and during a trading with a wandering trader. Cocoa beans come from cocoa pods, which are found on the trunks of normal-sized naturally-generated jungle trees in jungle, bamboo jungles and sparse jungle temperate biomes. The block itself can be obtained by inventory editing or add-ons in Bedrock Edition.\n\n  Breaking\n    Cocoa pods can be mined with any item, but axes are the quickest.

The log does not need to be attached to a tree. A cocoa pod can be placed on jungle logs, jungle wood, stripped jungle logs and stripped jungle wood. Cocoa has three stages of growth. During its first stage, the pod is small and green. In the second stage, the plant is bigger and colored tan. In its last stage, the pod is even larger and orange. The cocoa block has a 20% chance to grow a stage when receiving a random tick, giving it an average time of 5 minutes and 41 seconds per stage. When destroyed in the first two stages, the pod yields only one cocoa bean. When destroyed in the third stage, it gives 3 cocoa beans. Bone meal can be used to force the cocoa pod forward by one growth stage. Cocoa pods burst and drop their beans when struck by flowing water, pushed by a piston or if their log or wood are removed by any means.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing cocoa beans into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1.

To place an activator rail, use an activator rail item while pointing at a surface facing the space the activator rail should occupy. An activator rail can be placed on: An activator rail cannot be attached to the side or bottom of any block, but attempting to make such an attachment may cause the activator rail to attach to the top of a block under the destination space. For example, if a fence is on the ground, attempting to attach an activator rail to the side of the fence causes the activator rail to be attached to the top of the ground next to the fence instead. When placed, an activator rail configures itself to line up with any adjacent rails (including detector rails, powered rails, and other activator rails), as well as adjacent rails one block up. The behaviors in Java and Bedrock editions diverge in the following ways. In Java Edition: If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, or no adjacent rails at all, an activator rail aligns itself in the direction the player is facing. If an existing activator rail is connected to only one other rail or none at all, and a new rail is placed perpendicular to the activator rail, then the activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction (if it isn't already facing that way). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail \"prefers\" west or south). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails.[needs in-game testing] In Bedrock Edition:[needs in-game testing] If there are two adjacent rails on non-opposite sides, or three or more adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the east-west direction. If there are no adjacent rails, an activator rail aligns itself in the north-south direction (but if a rail is later placed to the east or west, the activator rail re-orients itself in the east-west direction even if it is already connected to another rail to the north or south). If a rail it would align with is one block up, an activator rail slants upward toward it (with multiple options to slant upward to, an activator rail \"prefers\", in order: west, east, south, and north). Other configurations can be created by placing and removing various rails. It cannot be placed suspended in midair, even with commands.[1]\n\n  Rail\n    Activator rails (and other rails) can be used as \"roads\" for minecarts. A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from either end of the activator rail continues to move, losing only a little velocity (which can then be increased again with powered rails). A minecart that enters an activator rail's space from the side turns east or south (depending on the activator rail's orientation), or in the downward direction for a slanted activator rail.\n\n  Redstone component\n    Activator rails can be used to affect minecarts that travel over them. Activation An activator rail is a redstone mechanism and can be activated by:\nan adjacent active power component (for example, a redstone torch, a block of redstone, a daylight sensor, etc.)\nan adjacent powered block (strongly-powered or weakly-powered)\na powered redstone comparator or redstone repeater facing the activator rail\npowered redstone dust configured to point at the activator rail, or configured as a plus sign.\u200c An activator rail is not activated by adjacent powered redstone dust that is configured to point in another direction. An activated activator rail also activates any adjacent activator rails it is connected to, up to eight away from the original activation source. Thus a single activation source can activate up to 17 rails (one original in the middle and eight on either side). An activated activator rail does not activate adjacent rails not connected to it. Behavior An activator rail affects minecarts above it with varying effects that occur as soon as any part of the minecart is on the activator rail. An active activator rail: An inactive activator rail enables hopper minecarts \u2014 an enabled hopper minecart picks up items it travels through until it is disabled by an active activator rail.\n\n  Mob interaction\n    Like other types of rails, spiders, cave spiders, and wardens are the only land mobs that can walk onto activator rails.\n\n",

In Java Edition, only cap blocks drop mushroom items, while in Bedrock Edition stem blocks drop mushrooms as well. Fortune does not affect the drop rate of mushrooms in any form.[1] The blocks themselves can be retrieved only by using a tool enchanted with Silk Touch. Mining the mushroom cap or stem yields a block with the cap or stem texture, respectively, on all faces. Additionally, in Java Edition, if two similar mushroom blocks are placed next to each other and one of them is broken, the side of the other block that it was facing reveals the pore texture. This is because the side of these blocks change texture if they touch another block of the same type.

This prevents players and mobs from jumping over them, while using only one actual block space. A wall occupies the center space of blocks. A wall block automatically connects to any adjacent solid block, and its top rises slightly to support any block immediately above. Walls are more efficient at fencing off mobs than a two-block high wall of cobblestone, costing half as many blocks, and being more space-efficient as well. However, a skeleton might shoot over the wall, a creeper could explode if a player is standing near the wall, and a spider could still climb over the wall. Unlike fences, if two walls are placed one block apart diagonally, the player cannot walk between them. Walls connect to other walls to create a large, flat wall. They also connect horizontally to iron bars and glass panes. However, they do not connect to fences (fence gates can be connected though).[1]\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Walls can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass drum\" sounds.\n\n",

In Java Edition it doesn't need a supporting block. In Bedrock Edition it breaks if unsupported.\n\n  Repairing and disenchanting\n    When used, an interface is displayed with two input slots and one output slot. Placing one enchanted item in an input slot forms a new non-enchanted item of the same type and durability in the output slot. Removing the item from the output slot consumes the input item and drops some experience. Placing two items (enchanted or not) of the same type in the input slots forms a new non-enchanted item of that type and with a durability equal to the sum of the durabilities of the two input items, plus 5% of the maximum durability of that item (rounded down), up to its maximum durability. Both input items are consumed in the process. If either input item was enchanted, then removing the output item drops some experience. The amount of experience dropped depends on the number of enchantments and levels of each, but it is partially random. For example, Fire Protection I gives 5-9 experience.[more information needed] As with all non-enchanted items, the new item has no prior work penalty. A grindstone cannot remove a curse. Grindstones also do not remove an item's custom name. If the action is not applicable (e.g. only one non-enchanted item, or the two inputs are different items), the arrow displays a red cross like that of an anvil and no item appears in the output slot.

Once the stem reaches maturity, it attempts to generate a melon block in one of the four immediately adjacent blocks; however, this attempt may fail if the chosen adjacent block is not empty or the block beneath is not an appropriate block (dirt, coarse dirt, rooted dirt, grass block, farmland, podzol, mycelium, moss block, mud or muddy mangrove roots). Melons take 10 to 30 minutes to grow, which is equal to 0.5 to 1.5 times the length of a daylight cycle. Once a stem has produced a melon, that stem does not produce any further melons until the existing melon is harvested. Melon stems connect only to the melons they produce. For example, if stem A generates a melon adjacent to stem B, stem B does not connect and can still produce another melon. Similarly, if a melon is placed adjacent to stem B, stem B would still be able to produce another melon. The same principle applies for pumpkins. Melons require a light level of 9 or higher to grow.\n\n  Trades\n    Villagers who are journeymen (level 3) farmers buy 4 melons for an emerald.\n\n  Composting\n    Placing a melon into a composter has a 65% chance of raising the compost level by 1. Composting a crafted melon block instead of 9 melon slices is very inefficient. For example, 100 melons could yield 9.29 bone meals on average. Meanwhile, if not crafted, 900 melon slices could yield 64.29 bone meals on average.\n\n",

A hopper has an \"output\" tube at its bottom that can face down or sideways and provides a visual indication of which block the hopper is set up to drop its items into, if that block has an inventory. To place a hopper, use the Place Block control while aiming at the surface to which its output should face (Hoppers do not orient themselves automatically). To place a hopper directly on the face of an already interactable block, the player can sneak while placing the hopper. Attempting to place a hopper aimed on the bottom face of a block instead faces downward. With some blocks, such as the furnace and brewing stand, the hopper has multiple uses. A hopper does not change direction after placement, and it is not attached to the container it faces; the container can be removed or replaced, and the hopper remains unchanged. Hoppers cannot be moved by pistons.\u200c[Java Edition  only] Despite not being a solid block, attached blocks such as rails, levers, tripwire and redstone dust can be placed on top of hoppers, but not on their sides.\n\n  Container\n    A hopper can be used as a container and has 5 slots of inventory space. To open the hopper GUI, use the Use Item/Place Block control. To move items between the hopper inventory and the player inventory or hotbar while the hopper GUI is open, drag or shift-click the items. To exit the hopper GUI, use the Esc key, B button or circle button, depending on the device. By default, the GUI of a hopper is labeled \"Item Hopper\". A hopper's GUI label can be changed by naming the hopper in an anvil before placing it, or, in Java Edition, by using the data command (for example, to label a hopper at (0,64,0) \"Steve's Hopper\", use /data merge block 0 64 0 {CustomName:'\"Steve's Hopper\"'}). In Java Edition, a hopper's GUI can be \"locked\" (or subsequently unlocked) by setting the hopper's Lock tag with the data command. If a hopper's Lock tag is not blank, the hopper cannot be accessed except by players holding an item with the same name as the Lock tag's text. For example, to lock a hopper at (0,64,0) so that only players holding an item named \"Steve's Key\" can access the hopper, use /data merge block 0 64 0 {Lock:\"Steve's Key\"}.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    A hopper can be used to craft a minecart with hopper.\n\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe\n\n    Minecart with Hopper,Hopper + Minecart,\"[[None, None, None], ['', 'Minecart', None], [None, None, None]]\"\n\n\n  Redstone component\n    While a hopper is not powered by redstone signals, it operates with three functions: A hopper first attempts to push any items inside it. Afterward, it checks if the block above it is a type of container. If so, it attempts to pull from it. Otherwise, the hopper attempts to collect item entities. Notably, hoppers can push to and pull from other hoppers, forming hopper pipes or hopper chains, which allow transporting items across several blocks and are further discussed below. When a hopper receives a redstone signal (and is considered to be \"activated\"), all three functions stop. To avoid confusion over the terms \"activated\" and \"deactivated\", powered hoppers are often described as being locked and unpowered hoppers described as being unlocked. Hoppers can be powered by soft powered blocks, meaning a redstone dust trail pointing into a block touching the hopper locks it just as effectively as a redstone block or any other power component touching the hopper. When the hopper is unlocked during a redstone tick, it does not push or pull/collect during the same tick, but has a delay of 1 redstone tick instead. While a locked hopper does not push or pull/collect items, it may still receive items from dispensers, droppers and other hoppers, and may have its items pulled out by another hopper beneath it. Hence, the item flow in a horizontal hopper pipe may be stopped by locking just one of the hoppers, but stopping a vertical hopper pipe requires locking two adjacent hoppers at the same time, such that both the pushing of the top one and the pulling of the bottom one are stopped. A hopper does not output any redstone signals by itself, but its fullness can be read using a redstone comparator, which needs to be placed next to it and facing away from it. An empty hopper outputs a signal strength of 0 and a completely full hopper outputs a signal strength of 15. Notably, a single stackable item (16 or 64) outputs a signal strength of 1 and a single non-stackable item outputs a signal strength of 3. In Java Edition, if the hopper being read is part of a horizontal hopper pipe, the comparator can individually read each item passing through the chain, because items are pushed through the hoppers one by one at a speed that is manageable by the comparator. If there is an uninterrupted stream of items, the comparator does not switch off in between items. On the other hand, in a vertical hopper pipe, some of the hoppers may never produce a reading above 0, even with a continuous stream of items, because pushes and pulls both occur in the same game tick: The hoppers' items get pulled out a single game tick after they're pushed in and this isn't measurable by a comparator, because comparators need measurements lasting at least 1.5 redstone ticks to produce a reading. A hopper collects items dropped on top of it if the space above the hopper not occupied by a storage block. Items are gathered from the entire 1 block space above the hopper, meaning that items sitting on partial blocks such as soul sand directly above a hopper can be collected.[1] It is also possible for a hopper to collect items from inside a full, solid block, a situation that might come from items rising up through solid blocks or being summoned. Item entities are not collected when they are outside of the collection area however; for example, items on top of a stone block directly above a hopper are not collected. Collected items are placed in the leftmost empty slot of a hopper's inventory. In Java Edition, if there is no container above the hopper, then the hopper collects dropped items in the order in which they landed on the hopper. This order is remembered even while a hopper is locked. For instance, if a hopper is locked under a carpet while a fully equipped armor stand is broken above it, then it always collects items in this order when it is unlocked: armor stand, boots, leggings, chestplates, helmets. This is due to the order in which these items land.[verify] In Bedrock Edition, hoppers do not remember the order in which items land on the hopper. Instead, hoppers with multiple dropped items above them collect the items in the order in which they entered the chunk in which the hopper is located. Items that drop from a broken armor stand are collected in a random order.[2] Hoppers usually check for dropped items every game tick and they can collect items even before they are picked up by a player[verify] or destroyed by lava. However, in Bedrock Edition hoppers have a \"collection cooldown\" time. After collecting an item (or stack of items), a hopper waits 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before attempting to collect again. Hoppers collect groups of items all at once rather than collecting them as single items one at a time. As a result, hoppers can collect item entities much faster than they can pull items from a container. Pulling from a moving minecart with chest or minecart with hopper is even slower, since the minecart is not always above the hopper. A hopper with a storage container above it (such as a furnace, chest, dropper, composter, or another hopper) attempts to pull from the container instead of checking for floating items above it, and hence can not collect dropped items.  A hopper always tries to push or pull items using the leftmost available slot. The hopper prioritizes pulling before pushing. When a hopper is removing items from a chest, the items disappear from left to right. Similarly, when filling up a chest, the chest fills up from left to right. Hoppers prioritize pulling from the first slot of a container over pulling into the first hopper slot. If a hopper has stone in its first slot and nothing in its second while the container it is pulling from has chicken in its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pulls the chicken from the first slot of the container into its empty second slot. However, if the hopper is unable to pull the chicken, such as if all slots are filled with stone, the hopper pulls the stone from the second slot of the container instead. Similarly, hoppers prioritize pushing from their first slot over pushing into the first slot of a container. If a hopper has stone in its first slot and chicken in its second while the container it is pushing to has chicken it its first slot but stone in the second, the hopper pushes stone from its first slot into the second slot of the container. In Java Edition the checks done by a hopper while pulling generally require less processing than the checks done by a hopper attempting collection. Therefore, a chain of hoppers topped with storage containers rather than air/solid blocks has better performance (measured as milliseconds of processing per tick) and lower potential for processing lag. [3] The performance improvement achieved is correlated with the number of storage slots the container has. Placing composters (with no storage slots but still with custom output logic) on top of hoppers provide the greatest efficiency, while double chests actually degrade performance, even when sharing each double chest across two hoppers.[3] In Bedrock Edition a chain of hoppers with air or non-container blocks on top has better performance than a chain of hoppers topped by container blocks.[4] This may be because, even though hoppers with containers on top do not check for items, they do check for hopper-minecarts and chest-minecarts to pull from, and that involves scanning the chunk entity list.[5] Hoppers also have a \"transfer cooldown\" time. After pulling and/or pushing items, a hopper waits 4 redstone ticks (0.4 seconds, barring lag) before pulling or pushing again (a transfer rate of 2.5 items per second, barring lag). A hopper that has an item pushed into it from another hopper also starts a 4 tick cooldown period, regardless of whether it pushed or pulled items itself. Item entities can be collected at any time without affecting the transfer cooldown time. The transfer cooldown and the Bedrock Edition collection cooldown are independent of each other. Some containers interact with hoppers in specific ways: Barrel, Boat with Chest, Dispenser, Dropper\nHoppers interact normally with barrels, dispensers, droppers, and boats with chests. Brewing Stand\nA working hopper on the top face of a brewing stand deposits only into the ingredient slot and it can push only valid brewing ingredients. A hopper on side face of a brewing stand can deposit only blaze powder or filled bottles into the three brew slots. A hopper underneath a brewing stand always extracts from the three brew slots, whether brewing is finished or not\u2014The hopper must be locked to allow potions to finish brewing. Chest, Trapped Chest\nLarge chests and large trapped chests are treated as a single container: a hopper depositing into a large chest fills up the entire chest and a hopper underneath a large chest empties the entire chest. Trapped chests being accessed by a player lock any adjacent hoppers, per the standard behavior of a hopper next to an active power source. Chiseled Bookshelf\nHoppers and minecarts with hoppers can insert and remove books from the bookshelf. As with any other container, items are taken from the first slot that has an item that can fit in the hopper and are inserted into the first empty slot. Crafter\u200c[upcoming: JE 1.21\u00a0& BE 1.21.0]\nHoppers can insert ingredients in the crafting grid. Items are distributed in enabled slots, going left to right starting from the first row; if the crafter has all item slots filled then items are added to the lowest count item stack of the same type. A hopper below a crafter collects the ingredients from the crafting grid, not the resulting item. Composter\nHoppers above composters can push compostable items into the composter's top face, with a chance of increasing the compost level as if the player used the item on the composter. Items that are not compostable cannot be pushed into the composter. Hoppers below the composter can pull bone meal when the composter is in stage 8, emptying the composter and resetting it to stage 0. Hoppers to the side of a composter do not interact with it. Decorated Pot\u200c[upcoming: JE 1.20.3\u00a0& BE 1.20.50]\nHoppers can deposit up to a stack of a single type of item into a decorated pot. Items are not pushed if the decorated pot is full or the pot contains a different item. Using a hopper (or a minecart with hopper) is the only way to retrieve items from a decorated pot without breaking it. Ender Chest\nHoppers cannot interact with ender chests in any way. Furnace, Blast Furnace, Smoker\nA working hopper pointing into the top of a furnace deposits only into the ingredient slot. It can push any item, including items that can't be smelted by the furnace. A hopper pointing into the side of a furnace deposits into the fuel slot, and only items that are usable as fuel. A hopper below a furnace pulls everything from the output slot and empty buckets from the fuel slot left over from using lava buckets as fuel. When a hopper removes items from a furnace, the experience points are 'stored' in the furnace until a player removes at least one smelted item, or the furnace block is broken. Hopper\nA sequence of three or more hoppers, each pushing items into the next, is called a hopper pipe. Working horizontal hopper pipes simply push items into each other at the expected rate of 2.5 items per second, but vertical hopper pipes are more complicated, as the hoppers are trying both to pull and to push. When a vertical pipe pulls from a single container, it simply transfers items at 2.5 items per second because the transfer rate is limited by the first hopper pulling items from the container. If a stack of items is in a vertical pipe, the items can be transferred twice as fast, because the hopper with the item stack is pushing items down while the hopper below it is also pulling items down. Jukebox\nHoppers can insert music discs into jukeboxes, and extract the music discs after they finish playing. A jukebox emits a redstone signal while playing a disc, locking any adjacent hoppers. Lectern\nHoppers cannot remove or place books on lecterns. The redstone pulse emitted from a lectern when a page is turned can temporarily lock hoppers. Minecart with Chest, Minecart with Hopper\nUnlocked hoppers fill chest minecarts and hopper minecarts if any part of the entity's hitbox is within the hopper's target block-space. Hopper minecarts try to pull items from the hopper at high speed. Hoppers can pull items from minecarts above them so rails can be placed directly on the top faces of a hoppers. If a detector rail is in the right position, it could lock the hopper per standard redstone-hopper behavior. Shulker Box\nHoppers cannot put shulker boxes into other shulker boxes. This allows for the creation of certain item filters.\nOtherwise, hoppers interact with shulker boxes normally.\n\n",

To do so, the player must use any of a selection of items on the composter. When an adjacent comparator is facing away from the composter, a comparator signal strength of up to 8 is emitted depending on the fullness of the block. Composters appear to have an empty interior. As such, entities can enter and exit a composter through the top, but not the sides or bottom. The composter has a \"floor\", whose height depends on the fullness. When the composter is completely empty, this floor is slightly above the block below, and when it is completely full, there is a slight dip on top. In Bedrock Edition, when the composter\u2019s fullness increases, any entities inside are pushed up accordingly.\n\n  Composting\n    The composter can be filled with compost, which is done by adding compostable items to it. When successfully adding an item, a green particle () appears. The table below lists supported items, which have different levels of compost-ability. The higher the percentage of an item, the more likely it is for it to add another layer of compost. While the composter is empty, any compostable item can create the first layer of compost. Each layer of compost has a podzol-like appearance. When the composter reaches the 7th layer of compost, the compost changes appearance indicating that bone meal can be collected by using the composter a final time. The following table shows the items that can be used in a composter, the percent chance for an item to add a level of compost, and the average number of items needed to fill a composter. Smaller pieces (individual pieces of wheat, melon slices, etc.) produce more compost than the blocks or other items that can be made from them. The exception is cookies, because each recipe produces 8 cookies, and together those give more than 3 times the compost. Despite being plants, it is not possible to compost bamboo,[1] dead bushes,[2] poisonous potatoes[3] and chorus plant products.[4]. Meat and fish are also not compostable, unlike some other food items.\n\n    Composting chance (per item)\n\n    30%,50%,65%,85%,100%\n\n    Items\n\n    Beetroot Seeds Dried Kelp Glow Berries Grass Block \u200c [ BE only ] Hanging Roots Mangrove Propagule Mangrove Roots Kelp Leaves Melon Seeds Moss Carpet Pink Petals Pitcher Pod Pumpkin Seeds Saplings Seagrass Small Dripleaf Sweet Berries Torchflower Seeds Wheat Seeds,Cactus Dried Kelp Block Flowering Azalea Leaves Glow Lichen Melon Slice Nether Sprouts Sugar Cane Tall Grass Twisting Vines Vines Weeping Vines,Apple Azalea Beetroot Big Dripleaf Carrot Cocoa Beans Ferns Flowers Fungus Lily Pad Melon Moss Block Mushrooms Mushroom Stem Nether Wart Potato Pumpkins Crimson Roots Warped Roots Sea Pickle Shroomlight Spore Blossom Wheat Wither Rose,Baked Potato Bread Cookie Flowering Azalea Hay Bale Mushroom Blocks Nether Wart Block Pitcher Plant Torchflower Warped Wart Block,Cake Pumpkin Pie\n\n    Average number of items to complete compost\n\n    23.33,14.00,10.77,8.24,7.00\n\n    Average compost yield (per stack)\n\n    2.74,4.57,5.94,7.77,9.14\n\n\n  Changing profession\n    If a village has a composter that has not been claimed by a villager, any resident villager who has not already chosen a job site block has a chance to change their profession to farmer.\n\n  Redstone component\n    A composter can act as a power source for a redstone comparator. With a composter behind it (either directly, or separated by an unpowered solid block), a comparator outputs a signal strength between 0 and 8, proportional to how full the composter is: 0 for empty, 1 for 1\u20447 full, 2 for 2\u20447 full, and so on to 6. 7 is for completely full but the bone meal is not ready to collect, and 8 for completely full and the bone meal is ready to collect. However, if there is a block between the composter and comparator, the comparator does not immediately update.\n\n  Hoppers\n    Composters can interact with hoppers. A hopper directly below a composter pulls bone meal from it. A hopper or dropper facing downward directly above a composter pushes items into it. See Hopper \u00a7 Redstone component for more details. Hoppers cannot interact with the sides of a composter. Composters are also often placed on top of hoppers when they don't need to suck items in from the world. This is because hoppers with containers on top of them don't look for item entities around them and the composter is the container with the less amount of information stored so this helps reducing lag.\n\n  Fuel\n    A composter can be used as fuel in a furnace to smelt 1.5 items.\n\n  Note Blocks\n    Composters can be placed under note blocks to produce \"bass\" sounds.\n\n",

In Java Edition, barriers are available in the Creative inventory if cheats are enabled and the \"Operator Items Tab\" setting is turned on.\n\n  Natural generation\n    In normal worlds, barriers don't generate naturally. In Java Edition, they only generate in debug mode worlds, where barriers generate as the floor.\n\nUsage\n    Barrier blocks are mainly used to build an impenetrable barrier that cannot be broken in standard Survival mode. For example, they can be used to protect a reserved area from entry by players, mobs, and other entities. Unlike other kinds of unbreakable blocks that could be used for this purpose (such as bedrock), barrier blocks are unobtrusive because they are invisible. Barrier blocks cannot be destroyed by TNT, creeper explosions, or any other explosions. Furthermore, they have a greater amount of blast resistance than any other unbreakable block. Unlike other operator blocks such as command blocks, barriers can be placed by players in Survival mode. In the player's inventory, the block is displayed as a red box with a slash through it, but when placed it is completely invisible. Barriers are transparent to light and do not block a beacon. Fences, iron bars, glass panes, and similar blocks do not visually connect with barriers. Barriers interact with blocks and mobs as a solid block. All dependent blocks can be placed on a barrier, such as torches or redstone, and it can suffocate mobs. Mobs cannot spawn on barriers. In Creative mode, if a player is holding a barrier block in their hand, all placed barrier blocks display the barrier icon as a particle. This effect is client-side, and if a player holds a barrier block in Survival mode, the particle does not appear. Barrier blocks are not shown if the particle setting is set to \"minimal\".\n\n  Waterlogging\n    Barrier blocks can be waterlogged by being placed into a water source block or by manually using a water bucket on them. In Java Edition, water cannot be placed in them or taken out by non-direct interactions such as dispensers; this is allowed in Bedrock Edition. In Java Edition, only players in Creative mode can waterlog or remove water from barriers, while in Bedrock Edition there are no game mode restrictions. In Java Edition, water doesn't flow out of waterlogged barriers. See waterlogging for more details on what blocks can be waterlogged.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Barriers cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed nor pulled by sticky pistons.\n\n",

The power level output varies depending on the number of entities colliding with the pressure plate. The signal strength from a weighted pressure plate does not vary with the type of entity. 15 mobs will produce the same signal strength as 15 different items.

It generates in abundance in deserts and beaches, generally in four-block-deep layers, supported by sandstone below. Sand also generates as the ocean floor of lukewarm oceans, deep lukewarm oceans and warm oceans, in a single layer not supported by sandstone. It usually generates in quantities of 545 blocks per chunk on average in non-desert biomes.[verify] Sand is also used to cover up buried treasure chests depending on where the chest generates in. (In this case, sand is used to cover up buried treasure chests that generate in beaches and ocean floors that are composed of sand, but in some cases stone or sandstone might be used instead). Sand also generates as part of warm ocean ruins, some desert village houses, desert wells, and desert pyramids. Both types of sand can spawn floating in the air. The floating cluster of sand falls when one of the sand blocks receives an update (e.g. when a block is placed near it or when a block near it is broken).\n\n  Chest loot\n    Item,Structure,Container,Quantity,Chance\n\n    Java Edition\n\n    Sand,Desert temple,Chest,1\u20138,\"59% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Sand\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20138\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5904, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Desert temple\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n    Bedrock Edition\n\n    Sand,Desert temple,Chest,1\u20138,\"59% { \"\"item\"\": \"\"Sand\"\", \"\"stacksize\"\": \"\"1\u20138\"\", \"\"chance\"\": 0.5904, \"\"structure\"\": \"\"Desert temple\"\", \"\"container\"\": \"\"Chest\"\" }\"\n\n\n  Trading\n    Wandering traders sell 8 sand for one emerald.\u200c\n\n  Post-generation\n    After brushing suspicious sand, the suspicious sand turns into regular sand.\n\n  Renewability\n    The only renewable method of obtaining either type of sand is through the wandering trader. Due to its low spawning rate and limited number of trades per spawn, it is more practical to obtain it through other means.\n\nUsage\n    If the supporting block below a block of sand is removed, it falls until it lands on the next available block. More specifically, the sand block turns into a \"falling block\" entity, which is affected by gravity; when the falling block lands on a block with a solid top surface, it becomes a block again. More information about the falling block entity is available in the main article listed above. If falling sand lands and covers the head of a mob or the player, the mob or player buried in it continuously receives suffocation damage. If falling sand lands in the space occupied by a non-solid block (such as torch, rail, or redstone dust) or a block less than a full block tall (such as slab or soul sand[1]), the sand drops and turns into an item. If it falls onto a cobweb, it falls slowly until it has gone through completely; if it touches the ground while still inside the cobweb, the sand becomes an item. Sand that falls onto a lifting bubble column floats on top of the water until the bubble column is blocked or removed. Though TNT does not break any blocks if it explodes underwater, if sand, concrete powder (in one-block-deep water only), or gravel falls and covers the TNT before it explodes, blocks are broken as normal. This trick can be used to collect blocks underwater, or break into underwater structures such as the ocean monument without mining.\n\n  Crafting ingredient\n    Name,Ingredients,Crafting recipe,Description\n\n    Concrete Powder,Matching Dye + Sand + Gravel,\"[['White Dye', '', ''], ['', '', 'Gravel'], ['Gravel', 'Gravel', 'Gravel']]\",Red sand cannot be used in place of sand.

It can be placed with commands in Bedrock Edition.\n\n  Breaking\n    Frosted ice does not have a preferred tool, meaning it breaks at the same speed regardless of the tool used to mine it.[1] Breaking it with Silk Touch drops nothing, while breaking in any other manner produces water in the same way ice does.\n\n    Block,Frosted Ice\n\n    Hardness,0.5\n\n    Breaking time (secs)\n\n    Default,0.75\n\n\n  Post-genereation\n    Frosted ice is generated by players or mobs walking near water while wearing boots with the Frost Walker enchantment. Frost Walker II creates a larger area of frosted ice. It can also be created by armor stands equipped with Frost Walker boots if they are pushed near water.\n\nUsage\n    Frosted ice behaves in most ways like ice: it is slightly slippery, causing entities to slide, including items. Frosted ice naturally melts fairly quickly. The block is created with an age of 0, and is ticked every 1\u20132 seconds. If a 1\u20443 chance succeeds or the block has fewer than 4 frosted ice blocks in the 6 blocks surrounding it, and the light level (including light from the sun) at the block would be greater than 11 minus the age, the age is incremented. When the age reaches 4, the block turns into water and all adjacent blocks have their age incremented (but if these blocks melt also, the effect does not continue to cascade). This does mean that in places with low light levels, such as inside caves or at night, it never melts naturally. The melting speed of frosted ice is only semi-affected by the randomTickSpeed game rule: setting the value to 0 results in frosted ice melting at the same speed as default, while setting it to higher than default does increase the melting speed.[2] When a frosted ice block melts or is broken, any adjacent frosted ice block immediately melts if it has fewer than 2 frosted ice blocks remaining in the 6 blocks surrounding it. Sugar cane and other crops do not break when frosted ice is formed, and frosted ice does not form on water occupied by another entity.\n\n",

The item form is completely nonexistent in Java Edition, but it can be obtained through add-ons or external editors in Bedrock Edition, or through using multiple glitches at once. The nether portal block can be placed using commands such as /fill or /setblock and is generated when lighting a nether portal.\n\nUsage\n    Nether portal blocks can stably exist only within a nether portal structure, unlike end portal blocks. When the block is updated and detects it is not part of such a structure, it is destroyed. However, using update suppression glitches, it is possible to obtain a standalone portal block without a frame, but the portal will be destroyed once it receives an update, i.e. placing a block next to the portal or moving a piston next to or into the portal. Nether portal blocks can be used to teleport entities between the Nether and the Overworld. When a player in the Overworld or the Nether stands in a nether portal block for 4 seconds, the player is taken to the other dimension. While in the nether portal block, the player can neither open their inventory nor interact with blocks with GUI. The player can step out of a portal before it completes its animation to abort the teleport. However, in Creative mode there is no wait time\u2014the player immediately transfers between dimensions. If there is already an active portal within range (125 blocks) in the other world, the player appears in that portal. Otherwise, a portal is created at or near the corresponding coordinates. If a single portal block is placed using commands, it can still be used to travel to the Nether. Nether portal blocks make distinctive sounds, and emit the same purple particles produced by endermen, endermites, and ender chests. Portal blocks emit a light level of 11, dimmer than a torch. Falling block entities can be teleported through a portal, but a piston cannot push a block through. Much like water or lava, portal blocks cannot be broken by tools except in Creative. However, portal blocks can be destroyed by explosions (even weak ones) and can be replaced by placing water or lava sources in the same block (can also be done by dispensers). If any portal block is destroyed, the whole portal is deactivated as adjacent portal blocks are updated and detect that the portal structure is no longer complete. While nether portals themselves cannot be lit in the End, a portal block set in the End and in custom dimensions behave exactly like in the Overworld, calculating coordinates in the Nether with the same 1:8 ratio. They teleport players to the Nether in Java Edition, and to the Overworld in Bedrock Edition.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    Nether portal blocks cannot be pushed by pistons. They also cannot be pushed or pulled by sticky pistons.\n\n",

In Bedrock Edition, it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing or add-ons. It cannot be placed by block placement commands in this edition, but it can be placed using structure blocks.\n\n  Post-generation\n    End gateway blocks form the functional part of end gateways. Each time the ender dragon is defeated, one end gateway spawns around the central island in the End, up to 20 times. Activating each of them spawns one additional gateway in the outer islands.\n\n  Natural generation\n    More naturally generated gateways that transport the player back to the obsidian platform can be found throughout the outer End islands.\n\nUsage\n    End gateway blocks in their original form can be used to teleport to the outer islands of the end. End gateway blocks can be used as a custom teleporter using NBT tags\u200c[Java Edition  only]. When created in a dimension other than the End without ExitPortal NBT data, it does not teleport entities but still activates its beam effect when an entity enters. In Bedrock Edition and Minecraft Education, when the gateway is placed and entered in the End, it teleports the user to coordinates 0, 0, 0, below the main island. In the Overworld or Nether, it acts as a solid block and cannot be entered.\nGateways have a small chance to teleport the player directly into the void at y=0.\n\n  Beam\n    When generated (either naturally as part of an end gateway, or through /setblock\u200c[Java Edition  only] ), the block emits a \u00a0magenta beam of light vertically from its top and bottom, lasting for 200 game ticks (10 seconds) while fading in and out. An end gateway block also emits a \u00a0purple beam of light vertically from the top and bottom when an entity enters it. During the 40 game ticks (2 seconds) this beam is visible, no additional entities can be teleported. It also emits the \u00a0purple teleport beam every 3600 game ticks (3 minutes). The creation beam extends from around Y=0 through the block up to Y=256; the teleport beam goes 50 blocks above and below the gateway block. The beam is visible from roughly the same distance as a single ordinary stack of blocks. If a render distance of 16 chunks is set, the beam of light is visible from up to 255 blocks away. Unlike the beam of a beacon, this beam does not change color if the player puts stained glass over it. It is not possible to disable either of the beams entirely. However, it is possible to edit the age of the block to a negative value, effectively delaying beam-emitting properties of the end gateway. You can change the age of the block by entering the command (for example) as follows: /setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:end_gateway{Age:-9223372036854775808L}. This will last for 14,993,257,186 years, effectively disabling the beam.\n\n  Piston interactivity\n    End gateway blocks cannot be interacted with pistons or sticky pistons.\n\n",

It can be obtained through add-ons, inventory editing, or using a /setblock with destroy to obtain the item.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Invisible bedrock comprised the border surrounding old worlds. It did not generate above or below the height limit, allowing the player to travel beyond it by flying over or under it, or by pillaring up and walking over it. This could not be done in the Nether in Survival Mode, because of the bedrock ceiling.\n\nUsage\n    The purpose of invisible bedrock is to prevent the player from getting past the border of the world. It cannot be selected; attempting to do so targets anything behind it.\n\nAppearance\n    Invisible bedrock is transparent only in rendering, interacting with players and mobs as a solid block and blocking light. Because of this, blocks such as torches and ladders can be placed on it. The player cannot interact with it; attempting to break an invisible bedrock block instead breaks the block behind it. The only way to destroy invisible bedrock is by using /setblock or /fill. Adjacent blocks are not rendered when viewed through invisible bedrock, so its appearance is always that of the sky behind it. The texture used for invisible bedrock is that of stone. If the player lands onto invisible bedrock, particles from the stone texture can be seen. In the inventory, the block is represented by a stone texture that fills out the inventory slot completely rather than being rendered as a cube like a normal block. In Pi Edition, it used the grass texture instead, as the game is based on an old version of Pocket Edition Alpha before the texture was changed to stone.\n\nData values\n  ID\n    Name,Identifier,Alias ID,Numeric ID,Form,Item ID [i 1],Translation key\n\n    Invisible Bedrock,invisible_bedrock,invisibleBedrock,95,Block & Ungiveable Item [i 2],invisible_bedrock Alias ID: invisiblebedrock,tile.invisibleBedrock.name\n\n\n",

Some of these features are leftovers from removed features, or simply placeholders for new features in future updates.\n\nMechanics\n  Enchantments\n    This is a list of unused features related to enchantments. In Bedrock Edition, players cannot enchant a block or item; only tools, weapons, and armor can be enchanted, even if the player is in creative mode. However, it is possible to apply enchantments to non-enchantable items or blocks using an NBT editor. By using an NBT editor, it is possible to apply enchantments that cannot be applied in-game normally, such as Fire Aspect on flint and steel or Blast Resistance on TNT. It is also possible to add multiple enchantments that are not compatible with each other such as Smite or Bane of Arthropods to a sword. Although the /enchant command in Bedrock Edition cannot enchant past the maximum level limit, it is possible to enchant items with a higher level than the max limit via the NBT editor.\n\n  Loot table\n    In vanilla behavior packs, there is a loot table for the giant, a mob that cannot be spawned in Bedrock Edition.

It is still available if the player already had it in a world prior to 1.10.0 or uses inventory editing.\n\n  Lava in cauldron\n    Cauldrons can be used to store lava, but always filled by 3\u20443 level. However, using /setblock or /fill command with different data values can obtain a cauldron with 1\u20445 through 4\u20445 level filled by lava, which normally can't happen due to the fact that dying leather armor and filling glass bottles isn't possible with lava.\n\n  Glowing obsidian\n    Glowing Obsidian blocks were part of the (now obsolete) Nether reactor. It emits a soft red glow at light level 12, and drops a single obsidian when broken with a wooden pickaxe. It can be obtained only by using inventory editors or a Silk Touch enchanted pickaxe and doing the Gravity Block Glitch. As of 0.12.1, this block doesn't generate anymore. The block may still be obtained using inventory editors or by retaining it from previous worlds before the update.\n\n  reserved6\n    This block was implemented as a temporary fix to a bug causing Fire to spread to any block. This block replaced any Fire blocks created in a world until v0.7.0 when the aforementioned bug was fixed.\n\n  Nether Reactor Core\n    The functionality of the Nether Reactor was removed in Pocket Edition v0.12.1 alpha. However, the reactor core block still exists in-game and can be obtained through inventory editing or by retaining it from previous worlds before the update. It now drops its ingredients, and cannot be obtained though normal methods or with Silk Touch. Prior to v0.12.1, they were used to activate the nether reactor. Tapping on it would activate the reactor if built correctly. When the core is activated for the nether reactor structure, the cobblestone and the blocks of gold are both replaced with glowing obsidian.\n\n  Paintings\n    In v0.5.0 alpha, with the addition of paintings to Pocket Edition, four unused 32\u00d732 paintings were present in kz.png that remained unused - using IDA and the Android libminecraftpe.so file, it has been found that the paintings are referenced from the game code, particularly in the Motive::getAllMotivesAsList(void) method (get all paintings), but the Painting::setRandomMotive(int) method excludes them as possibilities for a random painting. In v0.8.0 alpha build 2, despite still being unused, the textures of these paintings were updated to be more detailed. The paintings are named and designed according to the four classical elements - \"Earth\" features a brown square on a light brown background, \"Water\" is split into a lower light blue half and an upper blue half with a jagged line, \"Fire\" consists of three orange isosceles triangles on a yellow background, with the largest having a small red triangle inside it, and \"Wind\" features a beige hollow circle on a white background. According to Helen Zbihlyj[1], these paintings were originally added \"as part of a Pocket Edition promo map\" (no footage found) which was planned to be a part of Pocket Edition promotion at MINECON 2012 or 2013 and have never been used in game. The artist of these paintings remains unknown.\n\n  Update game blocks\n    The update game block looks like a dirt block with the word \"update!\" written with what appears to be grass. This was a placeholder for blocks that were put into the game before the full files made. It was available for the outdated version of 1.13.0 in Bedrock Edition. It could be seen if the player was playing with a friend on 1.13.0 and their device wasn't updated or if using an item in a world then downgrading Minecraft to a version that didn't have the block. Players can still get this by placing an Education Edition block, then disabling Education Edition, also using the /setblock command for a block called \"Unknown\" places this block, which can then can be broken and collected.\nIt wasn't called the update game block either, the name used numbers and letters.\nIt can be found if a friend runs a world on a newer version and all added blocks on that version then have this texture.  \nThere is also a version of this block with the word \"ate!upd\".\n\n  Invisible bedrock\n    In Pocket Edition, invisible bedrock made up the borders of old worlds. As of Bedrock Edition 1.18.0, it is no longer possible to create new old worlds, but it is still possible to play existing old worlds that were created prior to this update. The block is now unused, but it can still be obtained via add-ons or inventory editing. If obtained these ways, the texture in inventory is one face of a stone block, and the tooltip is tile.invisiblebedrock.name.\n\n  Old wooden slab\n    Before normal wooden slabs were added, another type of wooden slab existed with stone characteristics.\n\n  More explorer maps\n    Despite ocean explorer maps, woodland explorer and buried treasure maps being the only explorer maps that can be obtained in game, other explorer maps actually exist in the game files, and can be obtained only via inventory editing. These maps being: These explorer maps, named \"Unknown Maps\", have the same scale as the woodland and ocean explorer maps. However, when held, its name is changed to Map 0 and shows a green triangle to mark the destination structure.\nThese explorer maps have normal map textures but have the same layout as a woodland and ocean explorer maps, which are brown. They use stripes for bodies of water, and a sort of tan color for landmasses.\nIf the player obtains these unused explorer maps in an incorrect dimension, ex: obtaining a fortress explorer map in the Overworld causes the game to freeze and/or eventually crash.\n\n  Potions and tipped arrows\n    Some potions are unobtainable in normal gameplay, they appear in 3 different types: drinkable potions, splash potions, and lingering potions. Each potion also has its own respective tipped arrow variant, they are:\n\n  Tipped arrows\n    Besides the tipped arrows that are created from unused potions, some tipped arrows are also unused. These tipped arrows do not give any effects when shot at an entity. These arrows are tipped arrows from base potions:\n\n  Purpur blocks\n    There are unused data values of the purpur block that have the same texture as the normal purpur block and can be obtained only by /give or inventory editing. These are:\n\n  Unused grass variants\n    There are unused data values of grass variants which can be obtained only by /give or inventory editing. These are:\n\nResources\n    There are no items, placeable blocks, or /summon mobs for these, as they appear only as textures, meaning they are currently without use in-game. Some of these are from the Education Edition of Minecraft, and their textures still exist in Bedrock Edition.\n\n  Blocks\n    Chalkboard comes in 3 variants: slate, poster, and board. The camera's texture still remains, despite it no longer existing as a block, although it was re-added in beta 1.12.0.2, being obtainable with the /give command, but only as an item. However, the ability to get the camera using commands were removed again in beta 1.13.0.1. It is used to take photos because back then, phones didn't have the ability to take screenshots. Cameras are once again obtainable with /give in beta 1.16.100.54, and can now take screenshots. However it was removed again in beta 1.16.100.58. The exclusive blue rose was removed from the game, but its texture still remains as flower_rose_blue.png\n\n  Items\n    Items that were added during v0.16.0 development versions: The \nPortfolio was an item that can save photos that were taken with the camera. Comes in all 3 variants: slate, poster, and board. The camera item takes a screenshot and saves it to the internal storage of the device the game is being played on. Does not spawn an agent unless connected to a WebSocket server. The minecart with furnace exists in Java Edition, while in Bedrock Edition it appears as an inventory icon texture. The quiver was going to be used to hold arrows, but it was never implemented; Dinnerbone said that holding arrows in the offhand felt more natural.[2] Rubies were supposed to be in the game, but since Dinnerbone was color-blind and couldn\u2019t tell the difference between it and Redstone, it was scrapped, leaving only a texture. It was implemented in Minecraft Earth, with a completely different use and texture.  In 1.16.0, two textures named hoglin_meat_raw and hoglin_meat_cooked were added. They are textured identically to raw beef and cooked beef, respectively.\n\n  Entities and mobs\n    In the vanilla resource pack, a texture file for a tamed gray tabby cat exists. However, it is completely unused and cannot be spawned in-game. In the vanilla resource pack, textures exist, along with the other cat textures, for an ocelot texture, as well as the texture for a tamed ocelot. Again, it is completely unused and can't be spawned in-game. Nitwit villagers have existed in Bedrock Edition from earlier versions alongside its zombie villager version, but remain unused. Its texture still exists in the game files.\nNitwit villager and zombie villager added in 1.10.0 but they are new villagers with a different ID and texture, which means the old nitwit villager and zombie villager textures are unused. In the vanilla resource pack, there is a texture for a generic clownfish, which is completely unused, instead, clownfish are a variant of tropical fish.\n\n  Other\n    As of Bedrock Edition 1.2.0, a new panorama background is used, but the old panorama before 1.2.0 was not removed. Despite many updates to the main panorama, the (now unused) old panorama texture still exists.\n\nStatus effects\n    Some of the status effects in Bedrock Edition are unobtainable and can be obtained only by using inventory editing or /effect.\n\n  Health boost\n    Health Boost was added to the game in v0.12.0. It gives extra health that can regenerate. It can be obtained only with commands.\n\nWorld generation\n  Nether in Old world type\n    Nether Portals cannot be activated in the Old world type unless converted to the Infinite world type. As of Alpha 0.16.0 build 5, commands can be used by players to access the Nether in the Old world type without converting it to Infinite by using commands /setblock or /fill with the Nether Portal. The Nether in the Old world type looks like the normal Nether but is limited in size. It is the same size as the Overworld, which is 256\u00d7256 with a 128 block height. However, since the Nether and the Overworld have the same size, and traveling 1 block in the Nether is still equal to traveling 8 blocks in the Overworld, this leads to a problem that can make the game freeze or crash. This is the reason why the Nether can not be accessed in the Old world type. When the player goes to the Nether, a new Nether portal generates naturally in the Overworld, because a portal placed with commands is not counted. However, the player cannot make a nether portal normally.\n\n  End in Old world type\n    The End Dimension was added, and alongside it the End in the Old world type. The End is inaccessible because strongholds never generate in the Old world type and building an end portal also does not work. The only way to access it is via block-placement commands such as /setblock and /fill. Unlike the Nether in Old worlds, which can generate all structures, The End here generates just the main island and not the outer islands, due to the size limit of 256\u00d7256 blocks. However, sometimes the End in the Old world type generates improperly, resulting in the central island not generating due to the border. If this happens, the ender dragon may get stuck in mid-air at the border, and the exit portal generates halfway or does not appear. The end gateway portal is also nonfunctional, due to the size limit. These problems are the reasons why the End dimension is normally inaccessible, as the only way to go back to the Overworld is via cheats or death.\n\n  Biomes\n    Biome Name and ID,Features,Description,Screenshot\n\n    Legacy Frozen Ocean -116,\"Temperature: 0.0 Polar bears , salmon , cod , strays , \nCold underwater ruins , gravel , seagrass , kelp , snowy rabbits , ice , shipwrecks\",\"Similar to the frozen ocean biome, but without icebergs, it is completely flat. Rabbits , polar bears and strays spawn here. Rabbits have their snowy texture. No hostile mobs other than drowned , strays and skeletons can spawn. Kelp also generates here. This biome doesn't generate naturally from Pocket Edition Alpha 0.9.0 onward. when Bedrock Edition 1.4.0 introduced the new frozen ocean, this biome was not removed nor replaced by the new frozen ocean. However the id name changed from frozen_ocean to legacy_frozen_ocean\",Legacy frozen ocean\n\n    Desert Lakes 130,\"Temperature: 2.0 Sand , cacti , water , sugar cane ,\ngold rabbits , desert well , fossils , husk\",\"In this biome, patches of water are more common, and the terrain is slightly rougher. Although desert wells can be found, desert pyramids , villages, and outposts do not generate in this biome.\",Desert lakes\n\n    Mountain Edge 20,\"Temperature: 0.2 Grass , dirt , stone , llamas , emerald ore , infested stone , spruce trees , oak trees , snow\",\"Similar to the sparse jungle biome, the mountain edge used to generate exclusively at the edge of windswept hills biomes in order to smooth the transition between biomes. This biome has lots of trees, similar to windswept forests. While the terrain is lower and gentler in nature, some areas may reach high enough to be covered by snow. This biome doesn't generate naturally from Pocket Edition v0.9.0 alpha and Java Edition 1.7.2 onward.\",Mountain edge\n\n    Deep Warm Ocean 47,\"Temperature: 0.5 Dolphins , pufferfish , tropical fishes , warm underwater ruins , sand , seagrass , ocean monuments , guardians , elder guardians , shipwrecks\",\"Similar to the Warm Ocean biome, but without coral reefs nor sea pickles, and twice as deep. Because they are a deep ocean variant, they can generate ocean monuments, resulting in the spawning of guardians , elder guardians , prismarine , and sponges .\",Deep warm ocean\n\n    \"Hills 13, 17, 18, 19, 22, 28, 31, 33, 156, 161, 169\",Temperature: Same as their respective base biomes.,\"Hills are generated within certain biomes (including some of their variants) and are referred in the F3 menu with Hills added to their name (except snowy mountains). This includes: wooded hills, taiga hills, snowy taiga hills, jungle hills, desert hills, birch forest hills, tall birch hills, giant tree taiga hills, giant spruce taiga hills, snowy mountains, and bamboo jungle hills. Most hills are gentle rolling slopes on which the usual biome terrain generates, with some sharper cliffs here and there. Snowy Mountains have a lower chance of spawning passive mobs during world generation than other biomes (7% versus 10%). Giant spruce taiga hills are a special case. in Java Edition , the game code sets the values setBaseHeight and setHeightVariation to define a \"\"hilly\"\" biome, but uses the same values as for its non-hill variant (giant spruce taiga), meaning there is absolutely no terrain difference between the two biomes. In Bedrock Edition , this biome generates as a hillier version of the giant spruce taiga, but uses the same trees as the giant tree taiga hills (with leaves only at the top), resulting in the differences between these biomes being non-terrain aspects like water color and temperature.\",Giant tree taiga hills Desert hills Jungle hills Snowy mountains\n\n    Badlands Plateau 39,Temperature: Badlands Plateau\u00a0: 2.0,\"Badlands plateaus generate as a variant biome of the badlands, and are flattened at the top. They come to rest at an elevation of about 20 to 30 blocks above sea level. Similar to normal badlands mineshafts are capable of generating.\",Badlands plateau\n\n    \"Modified Plateaus 164, 167\",Temperature: Modified Badlands Plateau\u00a0: 2.0 Shattered Savanna Plateau\u00a0: 1.0,\"Two rare variants of the plateau biomes, which are variants themselves. However, neither of these biomes closely resemble their counterparts. Compared to the average badlands plateau, the modified badlands plateau features more variable terrain and smaller plateaus, as if a larger plateau was weathered down over time. It is the second-rarest biome in the game, after the modified jungle edge. The terrain of the shattered savanna plateau biome is much less tame than its normal counterpart. It features incredibly large and steep mountains that jut out of the terrain, similar to the Shattered Savanna biome, albeit slightly smaller and gentler in comparison. In Bedrock Edition , shattered savanna plateaus are considered a temperate/lush biome, making foliage a vibrant green color and allowing rain to occur in them.\",Modified badlands plateau Shattered savanna plateau,\n\n    Modified Wooded Badlands Plateau 166,\"Temperature: 2.0 Oak trees , dead bushes , coarse dirt , dirt , terracotta\",\"This biome features grass and oak trees on top of plateaus, much like its counterpart. However, the plateaus that generate here are generally smaller, allowing far less foliage to generate. The terrain is more erratic, and can be compared to that of the Modified Badlands Plateau biome. Eroded badlands generate instead of the desert alongside this biome.\",Modified wooded badlands plateau\n\n    Mushroom Field Shore 15,\"Temperature: 0.9 Mushrooms , huge mushrooms , mycelium , mooshrooms , buried treasure , shipwreck\",\"Mushroom field shores represent the transition between mushroom fields and the ocean, forming long strips between the biomes as a \"\"beach\"\", hence the name. However, it does not generate if the ocean biome is a Deep Ocean. This biome also generates when a river meets a Mushroom Fields biome, similar to what frozen rivers do in snowy tundras. The terrain of this biome is much more flat and shallow than the main mushroom fields biome, though it contains many of the same features, such as a mycelium surface layer, huge mushrooms, and lack of hostile mobs, but shipwrecks and buried treasure can generate here.\",Mushroom field shore\n\n\n  Custom superflats\n    There is an NBT string in every level.dat file called \"FlatWorldLayers\", which when edited properly, can cause the respective world to generate custom layers. This is used when Custom Superflats created on Legacy Console Edition get converted over to Bedrock Edition. Custom Superflats can, nevertheless, still be created without cheats through custom world folders.\n\nOther\n  Fifth giant tree taiga biome variants\n    The file biome_client.json contained a biome name that never existed in game. Out of the five giant tree taiga biomes, only four can generate in the game while another one, mega_taiga_hills, appears only in this code, as that biome is not defined in the vanilla behavior pack in the biomes folder. Whether the biome is a dropped feature or not is unknown. Colors: \u00a0#2d6d77 \u00a0#286378\n\n  World settings\n    level.dat contains several player abilities. Most of these are used in multiplayer, to determine who has what permissions. However, some are completely inaccessible without an NBT editor. With the exception of permissionsLevel, none of these settings can be altered in-game for the world itself, only for individual players. The flying changes in-game as players toggle flight mode, but cannot be altered manually without editing.\n\n    Ability,Description\n\n    instabuild,Whether the player can break blocks instantly. Normally true in Creative.\n\n    invulnerable,Whether the player is immune to damage. This immunity also affects / kill [ needs\u00a0testing ] and the void . Normally true in Creative.\n\n    lightning,Depends if lightning appears in thunderstorms.\n\n    flyspeed,The speed at which the player flies in Creative. [ more information needed ]\n\n    walkspeed,The speed at which the player walks. [ more information needed ]\n\n\nEntities\n  Armed zombie villager\n    The zombie villager was added, but it cannot spawn with armor equipped. However, armed zombie villagers are still spawnable via mob editing.\nIf a zombie villager is wearing armor, the helmet is struck through the head, the chestplate and leggings can be seen through holes in their clothes, while the boots look normal.\n\n  Wither skeleton archer\n    If a wither skeleton is equipped with a bow, it uses it as a ranged weapon, and arrows shot are always set on fire regardless of what enchantment it has, or if it has an enchantment. However, wither skeleton archers cannot spawn naturally. Minecraft Dungeons has wither skeleton archers.\n\n  Wither jockey\n    Spiders spawned in the Nether have a 1% chance of spawning while being ridden by a skeleton, which has an 80% of being a wither skeleton and a 20% of a normal skeleton. However, since spiders cannot naturally spawn in the Nether, this mob is unused. Instead, it can be spawned using spider spawn eggs in Creative mode. Wither jockeys also have a cave spider variant. It can also be spawned with commands.\n\n  Zombie horse\n    Zombie horses can be spawned only by using its spawn egg or /summon, as it cannot spawn naturally.\n\n  Zombie horse jockey (and variants)\n    These jockeys (see below) are unused since zombie horses cannot spawn naturally.\n\n  Baby trader llama\n    Trader llamas were added in beta 1.11.0.1, which at that time were breedable and could spawn a baby. However, as of beta 1.11.0.3, trader llamas no longer spawn naturally as babies since they are no longer breedable, causing the baby trader llama to become unused.\n\n  Ravagers\n    Some Ravager with riders do not spawn naturally and must be summoned using /summon:\n\n  Agent\n    The agent was added in alpha 0.17.0.1, although it was hidden in the .apk file of the game. However, it is still used in conjunction with Code Connection. \n\n  Camera\n    The camera was first found in the Pocket Edition v0.1.0 alpha .apk file, as of this version, the camera has functionality. As of v0.9.0, the camera entity was removed. Tommaso stated \"It doesn't mean that it's dead forever, in fact, I have a lot of ideas for it! I think it will be back when have shaders, sharing and redstone.\"[3] The camera was re-added in alpha v0.14.0, accessible only with inventory editors, but was removed again in alpha v0.16.0. However, the block can still be obtained in servers. Cameras were added again in beta 1.8.0.8, but it requires mob editing to summon it or using an NBT editor to get its spawn egg. The camera can now be obtained using /give as of beta 1.12.0.2. In beta 1.13.0.1, this item can be used by slide while using the item, the take picture sound can be heard and an explosion can be seen and a picture is saved to LocalState/screenshots folder on Windows 10 or /storage/emulated/0/screenshots folder on Android. However, Cameras are no longer obtainable using /give As of beta 1.16.100.54, Cameras are once again obtainable using /give. It was reverted again in beta 1.16.100.58\n\n  Old villager\n    Old villagers, prior to the Village and Pillage update are still available in the game, but they are instantly converted into villager_v2 (new villagers).\nTheir spawn egg can be obtained only via /give spawn_egg 1 15. However, trying to spawn them with that spawn egg spawns an old villager who is instantly killed. A new villager then spawns and take its place. Their trade tables were not removed, even though trading GUI has changed between Village and Pillage and prior updates.\n\n  Elder guardian ghost\n    The elder guardian ghost is an unused mob added in beta 1.13.0.4. Its file isn't included in the behavior pack, and it can be spawned only by using the command /summon elder_guardian_ghost ~ ~ ~.\n\n",

                    "context": "Overview\n    A bubble column is a non-solid block generated by placing magma blocks or soul sand in water (source). Bubble columns push or pull entities and items in certain directions.\n\nObtaining\n  Breaking\n    In Java Edition, bubble columns cannot be obtained as an item, and can be placed only by a block-placement command such as /setblock. In Bedrock Edition, it may be obtained as an item via inventory editing, add-ons, or bugs.\n\n  Natural generation\n    Whirlpool bubble columns appear naturally when magma blocks generate underwater, in clusters on the floor of aquifers, or as part of ocean ruins and ruined portals generated below the water surface.\n\n  Post-generation\n    When a magma block is placed underwater, a whirlpool bubble column is generated. When soul sand is placed under source water blocks, an upward bubble column is generated.\n\nUsage\n    Players and air-breathing mobs can enter a bubble column to replenish their air supply, at the same speed that they would when they leave the water entirely. The slower mining speed when underwater, however, still applies to players inside bubble columns. Water-breathing mobs avoid bubble columns because they suffocate if trapped in one. A bubble column is destroyed when moved by a piston. Bubble columns propagate only through water source blocks, stopping at any flowing water or waterlogged block. The height of a bubble column is limited only by the water's surface or by any obstructing blocks underwater. Bubble columns cannot be created in downward flowing water.[1] This can be circumvented by placing kelp in downward-flowing water, which converts it into a source block.\n\n  Whirlpool\n    A whirlpool, or downward bubble column, is the only type that naturally generates in the Overworld, often originating from magma at the bottom of underwater canyons. A whirlpool can be identified by the presence of air bubbles wandering downward. They drag entities downward. A boat ridden over a whirlpool shakes and eventually sinks if kept above the whirlpool for too long.\n\n  Upward\n    Upward bubble columns can be identified by the presence of vertically rising air bubbles. An upward bubble column accelerates entities upward; it is impossible to swim downward in one. The longer an object rises through the bubble column, the faster it travels. At high enough speeds, players and entities can be launched out of water by several blocks. Sitting on the surface above a rising bubble column causes entities to bounce upward repeatedly by about 1 block.\n\n  Transport\n    In Java Edition, entities move at a speed of approximately 11 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 4.9 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column. In Bedrock Edition, entities move at a speed of approximately 8 blocks per second when in an upward bubble column, or 6 blocks per second when in a downward bubble column.\n\n  Ender pearl stasis chamber\n    Projectiles such as ender pearls are affected by bubble columns. An ender pearl can remain afloat on top of an upward bubble column, allowing it to be stored indefinitely. A mechanism can then be triggered to make the ender pearl hit a solid surface (e.g. by closing a trapdoor), teleporting the thrower back to the setup wherever they are.\n\n",
