## Project Summary

This project aims to build upon a foundational work done in 2016, that established a corpus and a knowledge database for a Question-Answering (QA) system in the realm of a popular video game called 'Minecraft'. Given the multiple major updates to Minecraft since 2016 and the changes in methodology and modeling capabilities within the NLP field, we aim to update the dataset and ontology with the latest game data and subsequently develop and evaluate a QA system based on this enriched dataset. Our QA system aims to assist players by providing precise and insightful responses to their questions, including mechanics, crafting recipes, and other in-game scenarios.

The proposed solution includes data collection from trustworthy sources, updating the existing ontology, integrating new data with the existing dataset, and employing contemporary Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to develop the QA system. The expected deliverables include an updated dataset and ontology, a fully functional QA system, and comprehensive report of the system, our process, and the overall evaluation.

## Main Objectives

- Update and expand the existing dataset and ontology with the latest game data collected from the the sources listed in the original paper and potentially more websites.
    
- Develop a QA system capable of accurately answering player queries about the facts of the game.
    
- Evaluate the result and design future works. 


## Data Sources

Our work builds upon the foundation corpus laid by Dumont et al. (2016) and extends it by integrating an ontology-based approach and experimenting with various information retrieval and machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy and relevance of the answers provided by our Minecraft-specific QA system.
